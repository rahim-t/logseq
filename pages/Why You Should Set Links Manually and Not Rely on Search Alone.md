#### "Links are hand-picked references. The idea that makes you create a link is unique, and so is the resulting link. It's much more personal and thus better suited to help you think. Your personal and spontaneous associations count: they are due to a lot of factors not inherent to the material." ([Tietze 2015:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SKFNPNMC?page=1))

#### "If you wrote a note 10 years ago, I bet it's likely written differently than a note on the same topic you accidentally and unknowingly write today. Except for highly technical terms, your concepts will change and evolve. Relying on similarity of terms in the body of a note is not too reliable. Last, skimming a lot of search results is very taxing cognitively." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SKFNPNMC?page=2))

#### "The resulting web of connections is more than just a sequence of searches." ([Tietze 2015:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SKFNPNMC?page=2))

#### "without the internal references (which are links and tags) I'd have a hard time utilizing the Zettelkasten as external memory. The whole writing me, "being" part physical brain, part digital Zettelkasten, will remember worse if the Zettelkasten would not mimic the brain's structure." ([Tietze 2015:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SKFNPNMC?page=3))

#### "Search becomes more the source of inspiration than the mechanical tool to retrieve notes." ([Tietze 2015:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SKFNPNMC?page=3))

#### "Every full text search presents tons of Zettel notes. Because all are seemingly equal (and connected in the same way: not at all), you have to either rely on your memory to distinguish useful from useless notes, or look through all of them every time. Explicit connections make it easier to work with notes. Creating links is time well spent." ([Tietze 2015:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SKFNPNMC?page=3))
