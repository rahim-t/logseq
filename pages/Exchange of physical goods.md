title: Exchange of physical goods
---

## Write some recommendations where users can "drop" physical goods to store for themselves but also for exchanges.

## Inspiration from: [](https://taz0.org/bitstream/0x04-dropgangs/)https://taz0.org/bitstream/0x04-dropgangs/
### cafes which contain lockboxes for Airbnb-Keys: [](https://www.keycafe.com/locations?longitude=16.3725042&latitude=48.2083537&zoom=14)https://www.keycafe.com/locations?longitude=16.3725042&latitude=48.2083537&zoom=14 (Not epidemic failsafe)

### In some Cities light posts can be opened with [](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B017LXP40E/ref=sr_1_10?crid=14BYX38KDAXJS&keywords=dreikantschl%C3%BCssel&qid=1584704750&sprefix=dreikantschl%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-10)[https://www.amazon.de/dp/B017LXP40E/ref=sr_1_10?crid=14BYX38KDAXJS&keywords=dreikantschlüssel&qid=1584704750&sprefix=dreikantschl%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-10](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B017LXP40E/ref=sr_1_10?crid=14BYX38KDAXJS&keywords=dreikantschl%C3%BCssel&qid=1584704750&sprefix=dreikantschl%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-10)

### Bury boxes under trees, find them via acoustic signal, that starts only when authorised connection is established

## Buying Cacheboxes via plattform or via existing online-shop possible, as soon as [[Cachebox]] is available

## [[Geocaching]]

## distribution of [[Cachebox]]es
### as a part of [[exchange of talent]]

### how can diligence be ensured?
#### possible workflow including a second layer of verification/testing 
##### also as a part of [[exchange of talent]]

#### distributor deposits a batch (minimum 50) [[Cachebox]]es as service
##### goal of minimum batch-amount is to ensure that distributor isn't able to observe boxes 

#### knows coordinates and codes and encrypts them - platform knows the  key

#### randomly selects a few boxes for verification resp. testing

#### second layer verifies quality of distribution
##### coordinates and codes are given by platform 

##### the distributor doesn't know which ones are tested

##### tested boxes are out of batch because location and code is used

#### when distributor sells a boxes, he doesn't know which he sells
