### Introduction
#### Why do 90% of startups fail? Could the entrepreneurs as well as the investors have foreseen the failure if they acted differently? 

#### Peter Thiel analysed this questions and his answers do not only help you on your new startup. They can also help you as a Product Developer or a Project Manager when the task is to transform existing ideas into new products or features.

#### Peter Thiel is a co-founder of PayPal and the first outside investor in Facebook. His book Zero to One is full of unconventional advice for technology startups. As an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Thiel argues that the most valuable and game-changing startups create something new. They move the world from 0 to 1. 

#### Other companies improve incrementally on existing products. They move the world from 1 to n.

#### Although Peter Thiel makes the case for Zero to One innovation, he still doesn't disapprove world of 1 to n. This world is margin-decreasing and even google finds itself inside it when it comes to mobile phone development. But consumer experience and wealth thrives worldwide by more competition and globalisation.

#### Let's be honest - most likely your new product, your new feature, your new app isn't about Zero to One innovation. Your goal is not to build the next breakthrough innovation that will gain monopoly status like google search or facebook. Chances are high that you find yourself in a market with lots of competition where it's about gaining or loosing a relevant part of customers.

#### Peter Thiel's advice is still important if that's the case. Just look at his three most important insights: 

### 1. Technology
#### According to Peter Thiel breakthrough technology is key. For zero-to-one startups, the technology has to be either completely new or it has to be about 10 times better as the closest substitute available.

#### You can apply this rule also to your product development: You might not be able to invest big amounts of money in research, so gaining a big advantage seems to be unrealistic. But it's totally feasible to implement your idea with a state-of-the-art technology-stack. There are lots of experts who help you finding the right infrastructure, frameworks and existing SaaS-solutions for the implementation of your idea. 

#### Take this worst-case scenario: Let's say you are in e-commerce business and due to poor technological decisions, your online-shop infrastructure does not scale with your business. Loading times become longer and longer and more and more annoying for your customers who start switching to your competitor, decreasing your sales.

#### It's definitely easy to see that a focus on suitable and enduring technology is an investment that pays off in the long run: You won't trail your competitors, you will find yourself one step ahead. 

### 2. Team-spirit
#### When looking at a startup from a venture capitalist perspective, Peter Thiel puts the focus on the founders team
##### __" (...) one factor dominates all others. That factor is whether the founders are aligned with each other. This is key both in terms of structure and company culture. If the founders are in sync, you can move on to the rest of the equation." - Peter Thiel__

#### Thiel refers to his co-founders at PayPal as "conspirators", a tightly knit team on a mission. They hired people who would actually enjoy working with them.

#### This also holds for your product or project team - no matter if the members are internal or external to your company:

#### All members should be motivated by their innate desire to accomplish their mission of enhancing the world by building the best product possible. This is a so-called intrinsic motivator. And it works far better than simple conventional motivators like money or bonuses.

#### One insight from Peter Thiel is crucial when talking about a mission:
##### __"As a general rule, everybody involved should be involved full-time. (...) You're either on the bus or off the bus" - Peter Thiel"__

#### On a project basis this rule works the same as it does for a startup. The team can not be on a mission together the working half the time towards the goal. 

#### Try to work with a team that is bound together by their common mission that they pursue full-time. This mission then can be a long-term goal that prevents from non-sustainable short-term actions within the team.

### 3. Product Development Process
#### When it comes to product development, every startup should start with a small market.
##### __"You need to choose your market carefully and expand deliberately. (...) Every startup is small at the start." - Peter Thiel__

#### For your product idea this translates into focusing on one primary feature that generates value for your customers. Get out fast with it fast as an MVP, learn from your customer's feedback and evolve your product. Try to be the best in one small market area than to average in several areas.

#### It's key to have a process that allows for  quick, incremental product development, e.g. by developing a prototype first, something your alpha-testers can work with, something where you get feedback as early as possible in the development process. 

### Summary
#### Try to think about a fast implementation of your product, maybe as a rapid prototype to check your customers response. Especially think about outsourcing the development when your environment isn't compatible with the needed necessities in technology, team-spirit and development process. 
##### __"It's hard to develop new things in big organisations and it's even harder to do it by yourself" - Peter Thiel__ 

#### Our goal at Entwicklerkollektiv.Wien is transform our customers idea into rapidly built prototypes while following these three major insights from Peter Thiel. We know that technology, team-spirit and a fast product development process are the keys to success.

## Power law, zero to one
### vertical progress is not the case in most of the 

### you want a share of an existing market

### you need to find a local maximum when it comes to your product
