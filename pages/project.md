### not all involved will be part of [[project]] on a [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] - many are external. For them, some [[shareholder]] or other users of the platform for [[exchange of talent]] handle everything on the platform. Thus, users can bring in talents they trust, paying them outside of platform, and offering their contributions on the platform. Most talent will not care for a new platform with few users with very hidden and difficult to understand appeal.
