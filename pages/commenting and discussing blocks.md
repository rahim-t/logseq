title: commenting and discussing blocks
---

## it seems intuitive to add comments as indentend block nested underneath the block referred to
### yet, this may tend to sow chaos as comments are not as easily distinguished as in notion
#### however, indentation allows collapsing, this may suffice to keep the view structured and clean

### comments seem to be themselves a type of block and could be disinguished by tags, which can then be filtered [[Use [[tag]] to filter blocks according to user focus]]
#### however, tagging every single block and having to filter every single page does not seem useful

### some type of comments could be generally kept off to slack
#### all ad hoc comments that are better served by chat

#### better preview of block would be good in [[slack]]
##### [[Roam]] does not provide block links

##### for now, I have blocked previews from Roam in [[slack]]

##### will not work because only preview of public site can be seen by slack

## comments are brief ideas or questions which do not yet have enough structure to merit their own page (but should be more than chat)

## leads to the crucial question of [[exchange of ideas]]
