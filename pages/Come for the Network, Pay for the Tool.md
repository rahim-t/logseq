#### "Here are a few examples of burgeoning paid communities you might have already heard of: Stratechery: paid content + members-only forum, for investors and tech strategists. Venkatesh Rao's Art of Gig / Yak Collective: paid content + a Discord channel, for indie consultants. New Models: content aggregator + commissioned content + paid Discord channel (conducted through Patreon), for artists and cultural producers. It's also worth mentioning that Substack is currently layering on commenting + social features for paid newsletters, so many successful Substacks qualify. These new paid communities largely live on invite-only Telegrams, Slacks, Discords, and Facebook groups, raising the question: could there be applications more suitable to these networks? Indeed, the growing popularity of paid communities has been noticed by a bunch of new venture-funded companies such as such as Genevachat, Mighty Networks, and Circle, all of which want to become "the platform for communities." Ironically, these "community platforms" are themselves largely clones of Slack and Discord." ([Shorin 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=3))

#### "The reason for Patreon's erosion is that its product design is totally unsuitable for all three use cases: it's a bad brand platform, a bad content platform, and a bad social platform." ([Shorin 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=3))

#### "Slack's 10,000 message limit for free accounts is a major obstruction to doing knowledge work in these spaces, and Discord's free tier has lamentably small file upload size limits." ([Shorin 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=4))

#### "Discord and Slack's robust bot APIs are capable of solving some community needs. But fundamentally, they are still based on chat, and chat simply isn't the right core user experience for many other communities." ([Shorin 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=4))

#### "Replit is a community of young programmers, supported by a forum, a real-time collaborative IDE, and a library of openly forkable code projects. The deep integration between Replit's social space and its programmer tooling enable efficient knowledge workflows and sharing of user-generated content. At the same time, it facilitates the growth of a highly collaborative culture specific to this set of tools. Replit has gone the venture capital route, monetizes through a premium offering including paid cloud storage and unlimited private projects." ([Shorin 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=4))

#### "Are.na, founded in 2012, can claim to be one of the most successful indie social networks. (Disclosure: I am a shareholder through its Republic crowdfund.) Originally bootstrapped by a small community of NYC-based artists, it has grown to over 12,000 monthly active users, largely designers, artists, researchers, and educators. For these users the restrained interface, absence of an algorithmic feed, and community of intellectuals and cultural producers have made it a popular tool. As of May 2020, Are.na took in a respectable $20,000 monthly recurring revenue for its premium feature set (group features and unlimited private blocks), and posted strong retention numbers. Though some have described Are.na as "nerdy Pinterest," it is this same niche focus, "white cube" aesthetic, and longstanding community channels such as Freak Hacks and Images With Captions On Wikipedia that make it a choice place for designers and artists to collaborate." ([Shorin 2020:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=5))

#### "Among other social apps, Bloomberg Terminal features a Bloomberg Hacker News clone, a Bloomberg Craigslist clone, Bloomberg instant messaging, and Bloomberg-restricted email. From this perspective it is possible to view Bloomberg as a company that offers a full-stack set of social environments, news, and tooling for a distinct community with specific needs: financial workers." ([Shorin 2020:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=5))

#### "Bloomberg is an example of the classic Web 2.0 business maxim "come for the tool, stay for the network." But the inverse trajectory, from which this essay takes its name, is now equally viable: "come for the network, pay for the tool." Just as built-in social networks are a moat for information products, customized tooling is a moat for social networks." ([Shorin 2020:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=5))

#### "Running a bespoke social network means you're basically in the same business as Slack, but for a focused community and with tailored features. This is a great business to be in for the same reasons Slack is: low customer acquisition costs and long lifetime value." ([Shorin 2020:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=5))

#### "Aggregators like New Models and popular paid newsletters or podcasts which are increasingly cultivating community discussion may soon arrive at a point where their subscribers themselves generate enough interesting content to become part of the publishing workflow. What mixed media discussion + writing + recording social space would support this?" ([Shorin 2020:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=6))

#### "We're seeing a lot of new venture funded education communities, but here once more is a reason to be more excited about bottom-up community-driven businesses. What happens when groups of independent teachers or consultants who already chatting have shared interfaces to formalize, quote, and invoice? In the past, guilds have provided excellent education opportunities, and they can again." ([Shorin 2020:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=6))

#### "The evolution of fan forums probably looks more like bespoke interfaces designed by the companies which actually create the characters. JK Rowling's "Pottermore" is an early example of what this looks like; later communities will likely be more video-focused, and will borrow from the ARG toolkit to involve users in ongoing plotlines or reality TV style dynamics." ([Shorin 2020:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=7))

#### "The crypto community has spawned several interesting use cases for bespoke, paid social networks. Some crypto protocols, like Compound and Maker, allow token holders vote on changes to a token economy. Other crypto communities, like Moloch and its siblings, have users buy in with their own funds and then vote how they should be collectively allocated. These tools are still rudimentary, but here we see a tight integration of tooling and discussion that is applicable in other governance contexts" ([Shorin 2020:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZXH4EQN5?page=7))
