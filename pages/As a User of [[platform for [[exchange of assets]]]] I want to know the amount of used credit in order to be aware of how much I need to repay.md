title: As a User of [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] I want to know the amount of used credit in order to be aware of how much I need to repay
---

## At the moment:
### If a user makes an offer with a specific amount - and there is a bid on that offer, the line of credit of trust increases with that specific amount.

### This credit of trust can be transferred into trust.
#### When transferred, the amount trust increases and the amount of credit of trust of credited trust drops. 

#### At this moment the user cannot see how much of the trust is from credit and how much is earned.
##### Workaround: The maximum payback-amount when clicking on "Transfer" is the Amount already credited for trust.

## For better usability, the credit line of Trust as well as the used amount of this credit line should always be shown
