### Ends vs. means?
#### means = [[technology]]

## workflow for learning vs. workflow for projects/ventures/doing

:END:
### May learning be more actionable and ventures be more exploratory to reduce the difference?

### learning increases uncertainty vs. doing reduces uncertainty?
#### - learning only increases feeling of uncertainty and risk of being overwhelmed by uncertainty

#### - doing may not reduce uncertainty, but focus away from it to what is actionable

### why vs. what
#### - frequent advice for ventures: start with why!

### steps â€“ are they similar or different for learning vs. doing?
#### done = ready for delivery or publication

#### doing = actively working on getting to done

#### specified/backlog = decided, ready to be worked on
##### how to track and change priority?

#### to be specified/decided = relevance of idea or task

#### in discussion = taking shape, formulating and structuring ideas or tasks

#### inspiration leading to ideas or tasks

### looking at desired end-result is important
#### publishing to add to common knowledge?
##### there is no such thing as [[public discourse]]
