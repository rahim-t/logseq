### **Yellow Annotations (8/3/2020, 9:47:18 AM)**
#### "Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning […] it's an entire academic discipline studying how we can build digitally-mediated Communities of Practice for learning" ([Appleton 2020:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2B9SNJB?page=1))

#### "collaboration in and of itself doesn't magically produce understanding. Instead, it needs to be designed, structured, and carefully facilitated to lead to learning. The most effective techniques are not surprising... Meaningful discussion, debate, and negotiation that forces us to question our assumptions and revise our conclusions. Explaining your thinking to another human, out loud or in writing, quickly shows how well you know the material. Solving a problem, then comparing your solution to someone elses, and mutually agreeing upon the strengths and weaknesses of each." ([Appleton 2020:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2B9SNJB?page=2))

#### ""Collaborative Learning does not just mean that individual learning is enhanced by participation in small groups; it means that it is the groups themselves that learn." Knowledge is a product of the collaboration process: it arises through interaction of different perspectives, heats up in the cauldron of public discourse, is gradually refined through negotiation, and is codified and preserved in cultural or scientific artifacts" Computer Support For Collaborative Learning: Foundations for a CSCL Community - Stahl (2002)" ([Appleton 2020:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2B9SNJB?page=2))

#### "CSCL Macro-scripts describe how a learning experience will play out. On a general level, they define a sequence of activities focused around a learning goal. The learners all have assigned roles and follow a set of constraints and rules for interaction." ([Appleton 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2B9SNJB?page=3))

#### "Most of us have been in meetings with assigned facilitators and scribes, but we rarely expand beyond these. Why stop there? What if we add in... A Research-Runner who is in charge of fetching up links and references mentioned in the discussion. A Sceptic or Devil's Advocate who (constructively) raises objections and counteropinions A Timekeeper who moves us through the learning plan on schedule A Summariser who captures the group's conclusions in succinct statements A Reflector who mirrors people's points back to them in their own words An Explorer responsible for gathering wildly off-beat references outside the traditional domain There's a huge range of role options that you can pick and choose from depending on the size, synchronicity, and goals of the group. The Group Work Roles page on EduTech Wiki (an overall great place) elaborates on this list." ([Appleton 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2B9SNJB?page=4))

#### "Coined by Etienne Wegner, a community of practice is a group of people "who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise by interacting on an ongoing basis." […] It's a collection of people who are into the same stuff as you, that you end up stumbling into organically. In an ad-hoc decentralised way, you start collectively problem-solving and learning with them in a weird, emergent, beautiful process. No one plans the community. No one regulates or controls it. There is no central calendar of events. You earn membership by proving you have the right domain expertise and Cultural Capital to belong there." ([Appleton 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2B9SNJB?page=4))
