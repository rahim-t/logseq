## Company creation by business proposition, capital cap, seed investment of coins by one user
### minimum seed investment by founder: 500

### Pivots possible = change of business proposition

## Company is a new entity on the platform
### All transactions under review process

### Internal forum & judgement

### Operates like personal account on market etc., can buy/sell

### Has [[Honor]]

### [[shares]] are another Coin, wallet controlled by company

### Suggestion for a temporary simple solution: Wallet controlled by Founder1 ( or multisig wallet) where users can sent credits to. Shares are calculated according to credit sent.

## company structures flexible
### committees = specified groups of shareholders
#### majority/unanimity

#### number of shareholders

#### min shares

#### random

#### for review/decision tasks ([[prize]]s set as remuneration)

#### Default committee: all shareholders, majority

#### Apply/propose for committees

### only shareholders decide, all external "employees" on freelancer model: complete jobs defined and reviewed by shareholders

## Company process:
### Company formation = business idea, specification, seed investment
#### Product development in Scrum sprints: 4-7 people, limited time, if possible at one location, financed by company

#### Product development must lead to prototype, market test, deliverable product, processes

#### processes are code or perfect specifications ("code for people")

#### Freelancers can be hired on the basis of such specifications, employees can be instructed and reviewed.

### Skill indicated by skill bet in referral, earned through participation in successful scrums

### Product development success: Judgement of shareholders who are not part of scrum team plus judgement of scrum team members plus dividend increase over time

### Knowlegde workers (product developers) vs. freelancers (product executors)

### First are autonomous part of capital structure, which usually means social interaction

### Second are (usually, but not necessarily isolated) workers on specified tasks

### "Employees" of company: either knowledge workers for limited time in specified structure (team) or outsourced as freelancers

### Potential product developers specify honorarium, percentage taken in shares, availability, experience and expertise (what problems can I solve?)

### Scrum sprint

### all remote or all collocated

### Team members can be excluded any time by unanimous vote of all other members, if contribution insufficient/negative

### either pay back expenses/head, then just no Skill increase

### not willing or able to pay back: Skill reduction by 10% of expenses/head

## outside income
### Shareholders offer bank accounts to receive income, best offer accepted by shareholders

### Best offer = least spread (coins for received â‚¬ on account)

### ( Would leave that to the shareholders, as some banks offer other advantages which might be useful even if the spread is not the best... e.g. possibility to share access to the bank account like on paysera or maybe it's known that a bank doesn't block big transfers or maybe it's a bank account in a country where it's not that easy to get a bank account at all but it would help the business case )

### Account holder (controller) owes company coins (at set rate for received income)

### Can choose to have his income share deducted = owes less coins than income instead of receiving coins as dividend

### Has to show account statements according to review requirements

### Either scan or personal meeting, looking over shoulder into account

### Review - judgement by reviewers, minimum certainty set as requirement
