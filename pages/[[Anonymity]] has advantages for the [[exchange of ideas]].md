### dazu verleitet, sich noch unsensibler auszudrücken?
#### Sensibilität und Höflichkeit sind keine Kategorien des Diskurses

## [Announcing Club P., an anonymous discussion board - Sometimes Right](https://sometimesright.com/2020/08/03/club-p/)

### [Club P.](https://club.sometimesright.com/) and it’s an anonymous and ephemeral discussion board like 4chan, but membership-based.

### increasingly frustrated with social media. Speech policing and growing pressure to conformity are leading me and many others to retreat to what Venkatesh Rao calls the [cozyweb](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe):

:END:
#### Unlike the main public internet, which runs on the (human) protocol of “users” clicking on links on public pages/apps maintained by “publishers”, the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot. It lives in a high-gatekeeping slum-like space comprising slacks, messaging apps, private groups, storage services like dropbox, and of course, email.

### Kickstarter founder Yancey Strickler talks about a “[dark forest theory of the internet](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1)”:

#### In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.

#### This very piece is an example of this. This theory was first shared on a private channel sent to 500 people who I know or who have explicitly chosen to receive it. This is the online environment in which I feel most secure. Where I can be my most “real self.”

#### Dark forests like newsletters and podcasts are growing areas of activity. As are other dark forests, like Slack channels, private Instagrams, invite-only message boards, text groups, Snapchat, WeChat, and on and on. This is where Facebook is pivoting with Groups (and trying to redefine what the word “privacy” means in the process).

:END:

#### These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments. The cultures of those spaces have more in common with the physical world than the internet.

### On social media platforms like Twitter, users have a persistent identity (even if, rarely, it is a pseudonym). This fosters completely natural incentives for [status competition](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Animal-Science-Evolutionary-Psychology/dp/0679763996/), but those incentives are unnaturally exacerbated by the [gamification](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy-ebook/dp/B07DBRBP7G/) inherent in likes, retweets, and follower counts. Additionally, your view on the world is limited by the set of people you have chosen to follow, as well as how a platform’s algorithm has chosen to present their messages. The result is conversation that is often performative and susceptible to groupthink and tribalism.

:END:

### An interesting alternative mode of online conversation that is still public, and not cloistered, is that of anonymous “[imageboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard)” made (in)famous by 4chan. They are web discussion forums with no user registration and no identities tied to posts. Postings are also ephemeral and are erased after a short time.

### Because user content is presented chronologically, and neither you nor an algorithm curate what you see, you’re exposed to a greater set of expressions.

:END:

### Such a peculiar arrangement can engender unreserved contributions to group creativity, which is why the origins of so much of what we take for granted as “internet culture” today—from lolcats to rickrolling—can be traced back to 4chan. As Hao Li has [put it](https://www.ibtimes.com/anonymity-internet-4chan-277953),

:END:
#### [[Anonymity]] frees individuals from the burden of the ego, which is afraid of judgment, wants recognition, and acts defensively towards disagreements from others. In a collaborative environment, it blocks creativity and distorts incentives. When the ego is removed, unfiltered and raw truth comes out. … Once the ego is gone, anonymous individuals identify with an amorphous entity that transcends individuality. It’s not that online anonymity leads to groupthink; it actually encourages creativity and non-conformity. Instead, anonymity brings individuals closer through cutting the personal prejudices and allegiances that divide them apart in real life.

### anonymity can have a very dark side. Without identity there is no accountability, and without account registration there is no way to screen out trolls and troublemakers.

:ID:00d02d78-10bb-40da-9131-39f85a616271
:END:

### Club P. is essentially an anonymous discussion forum but with important differences compared to traditional imageboards. Most significantly, you have to be a member to post, and membership costs $2 per month.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:843f1ee2-4987-4b29-ae96-483dd1e0a4d5
:END:

### No identifying information will ever be presented on the site—no username, nor email address, nothing. On the backend, however, users are assigned a unique alphanumeric ID (like 5f20bwcd1f516020410b8e9) and their posts are associated with that ID so that, if I had to do it, I could ban the author of a particular post without ever knowing their name.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:0cbd7812-fe2e-4940-a559-4e2aeb40ee8c
:END:

### On the homepage is a listing of all threads posted in the last 48 hours. After 48 hours threads are deleted, so all conversations are ephemeral. (I would like to eventually bring that down to 24 hours or less.) Anyone can read the threads, but only logged-in members can start new threads and post replies to existing threads.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:4fcc8414-a6e7-4dce-b31c-817aa9ed7bf7
:END:

### The design of the site is heavily influenced by Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood’s thinking on forum architecture. Threads are [flat rather than presented in a tree structure](https://blog.codinghorror.com/web-discussions-flat-by-design/). If a link to a thread is blue on the homepage, then either you haven’t visited it or there is a new reply post you haven’t seen.

:END:

### As Spolsky says, “posting rules is just a way to insult the majority of the law-abiding citizens and it doesn’t deter the morons who think their own poo smells delicious and nothing they post could possibly be against the rules.” Things will get deleted when they have to be and users will be kicked out when necessary
