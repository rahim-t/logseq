title: Treuhaenderische Aufbewahrung von Assets

## Matching of "interfaces": willingness and ability to take, hold and deliver assets in locations/accounts

## Separation of ownership and property

## New token for custody: as one gives own property in custody of others one can keep others' property in custody and vice-versa

## Users with tax-free access to exchanges/financial products could serve as brokers for others

## holding positions as [[Trust]]ee, paying out net dividends and sale proceeds in [[Trust]]

## Offer of liquidity at exchanges with specification of possible assets

## Problem: as position is held for others, this has to be represented (digital safe-keeping)
