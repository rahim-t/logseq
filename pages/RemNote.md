### RemNote doesn’t allow to query your tags yet.

### RemNote doesn’t have any graph components in its basic version. This means you can’t create visual connections between ideas. However, there is a [plug-in](https://observablehq.com/@dmrd/remnote-tree-graph-viz)that allows you to built visual relations in RemNote as well. It’s far more complicated, but it’s possible.

### RemNote is far more developed for studying. It makes it easy to create flashcards while taking notes. It also has a built-in Spaced Repetition algorithm that allows you to review your flashcards within a queue.

### Roam offers more possibilities for Task and Project Management.

### **RemNote already has an API**.

### it’s **free**

### plans to release a “pro subscription” in the far future with extra features and extra data storage

### At the moment, RemNote is definitely “the little brother” of Roam. **It focuses more on study-oriented note-taking** with its built-in Spaced Repetition system.

### I use RemNote for discrete information I want memorize or learn and Roam for information I want to keep but am not sure what I’ll be using it for later. Big fan of both but if you’re trying to learn/memorize I’d definitely go with RemNote whereas Roam seems more like a place for compounding/building knowledge/making connections.

### Most of the Roam features missing in RemNote are a bit hidden in Roam, like diagrams (which I find essential for making sense of non-verbal semantics) and queries. Perhaps the two most visible Roam features missing in RemNote are filters in the backlinks section, and the graph view.

### For future development, I see Roam more oriented towards remixing personal ontologies and taxonomies into a kind of federated wiki, whereas RemNote more focused towards remixing personal learning curricula in various flexibly structured contexts. Both very exciting!

### I'm using Roam for the diagrams and RemNote for learning and recalling, but I'm not aware of an easy way to sync between them.
#### in the paragraphs above, a problem (?) arises and gets highly visible: who wrote these paragraphs, obviously it was not __me.__
##### Toggle Edit Icons: C-c C-c C-s (C=Ctrl)

#### now, one can say, it doesn't matter who wrote it, because it is relevant (which it is) and therefore it makes sense to enrich the zettelkasten. But, I want to know who wrote because only then I can interpret the text hermeneutically correct. I need to know (at least a bit) of the background of the person, so that I can evaluate the statements.

#### On the other hand, to not know who wrote makes the statements free of prejudice and bias. Maybe an advantage.

#### Now, you might want to know who wrote these thougths here? [[RG]]

### **Advantages of Roam**

### __cleaner, simpler interface__

### Roam just generally looks slicker, better designed, less cluttered, etc. There are also usually fewer interactive elements visible, or features whispering your name to be used by you. For example, Roam doesn't make me think about how many blocks I want to hide under a block - it's just all or none. RemNote allows me to hide only some of them.

### Overall, Roam reduces the things I need to (or feel I need to) think about writing, before writing my thinking. This is a significant advantage.

### __smoother/less clunky__

### related to the above, but I find many small things about RemNote that kinda break the flow of things, whether I forget one of the zillion keyboard shortcuts, or my cursor jumps somewhere unexpected... I find Roam

### __attributes__

### Roam has attributes, which currently aren't good for anything except generating tables. But supposedly they will be making it into an awesome feature. RemNote is also developing special "universal descriptors" which will probably be similar. Remains to be seen.

### **Advantages of RemNote**

### __every Rem is a first-class citizen__

### maybe it's just me, but I'm really bothered by the fact that Roam makes a big difference between "page references" and "block references". Differentiating between them is pointless in my opinion. I prefer the way RemNote just has "rem" and the rem that don't have any parent are simply called "top-level rem" that are dealt with the same way as other rem

### __portals__

### Roam has page embeds and block embeds, but I find portals to be a much more natural way of doing the same thing

### __search portals__

### search portals are easier to use and (maybe?) more powerful than Roam's query

### __type parents and type children__

### Roam really needs this. RemNote allows me to simply use a double `#` in any rem and assign it a "type", which is another rem under which I have previously defined "slots". I find it especially great for taking notes on readings; I just put a `#`reading in my rem, then I get all my "author", "publication info" etc ready for me to fill in underneath

### __more features in general__

### this is a qualified advantage though, as it does make RemNote more cluttered (as mentioned above)

### It tries to reify a highly opinionated knowledge model, but it’s much too literal: the model has an intense, oppressive formality.

### Like Roam, it encodes the belief that text blocks, structured in this model, can be made into reusable units. I’m worried about their composability: Transclusion is limited by the data model’s composability.

### You own your data - always. You'll be able to export all data in its raw state and import it to another tool.

### We'll always provide a feature-rich, free-for-life version of RemNote.

### Why RemNote?

### Note-taking empowers you to think and process information more effectively. Note-taking with RemNote empowers you to think, organize, and process your ideas in a sustainable, nimble, and permanent way. Our users rely on us to structure, retain, and support a significant part of their externalized memory.

### We fully appreciate the critical importance of retaining consistent and unfettered access to your RemNote account and data - forever. You can count on us to ensure you never have to worry about access, retention, or commitment. Focus on your work and your learning. We’ll take care of the rest.

### The Team

### RemNote began as a research project at MIT. We recently spun out into a small team committed to building the best spaced-repetition powered memex available.
