title: Link between Asset Exchange and Knowledge Exchange
---

## The analogy to work with is the 19th century Saloon as the centerpiece of an enterpreneurial and intellectual network

## In our network the Knowledge-Hub is the centerpiece of a modern enterpeneurial and intellectual network with the goal to gain deeper insights about the world. In the original Salon, there was a strong self selection of members. In the internet we can't rely on that, we need different mechanisms, especially when we want the network to be anonymous and open to everyone qualified. So the question we need to answer is, how could a self-selection of likeminded intellectuals and entrepreneurs look like in the internet?

## The obvious mechanism to select the "intellectual" members is the Wisdom Reputation as we discussed, but that mechanism doesn't work for practical entrepreneurs, who want to have access to information without the necessity to contribute by doing pure intellectual "paper" work.

## To get the right entrepreneurs into the knowledge exchange, we need an entrepreneurial network (what we started to build already) which is the access layer around the knowledge centerpiece, where entrepreneurs can interact with each other and prove their [[Trust]]worthiness by exchanging valuable goods and services for [[Trust]] and [[Trust]] is what gives them access to the knowledge-centerpiece.

## As the 19th century saloon is the model we want to follow, it's not enough to just simply sell  information access ( no one sold tickets for the Salons either ), being an active part of a Trust network is what matters. As the intellectual network is a P2P network, there is also no central authority which could collect payments, integrate a payment provider or even decide which currency is acceptable.

## At a first glance it might seem odd to create a sophisticated asset exchange and trust network for entrepreneurs just to give them access to an intellectual exchange, but if one truly wants to recreate smth. like the 19th century saloon with the extended capabilities of the modern web, it's an absolute necessity.

## Note:

## [[scholarium]] seems to resemble this structure already in parts. Different members gain access to the knowledge exchange using different ways (Werkstudenten contribute work, Members pays for access, interesting entrepreneurs might get invited ...  )
