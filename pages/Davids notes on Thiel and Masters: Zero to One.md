## Horizontal vs Vertical progress
### 1 to n vs 0 to 1

### globalisation vs. technology

## Education is only Horizontal progress

## Contrarianism enables Vertical progress
### The Question that Thiel asks in interviews

### {{embed ((c5e57754-fbb5-40c4-83e7-5bcf0e3a86da))}}

### Contrarians are important because there is a chance that through their different view they help achieving a 0 to 1 change from the present - that means, shaping future

## Bubbles in contrast to Contrarianism
### ((81b6e39b-28b6-414c-ab4a-16143e99cf19))

## Dot-com-bubble lead to wrong beliefs
### No Grand Visions, but incremental advances
#### due to an indefinite optimistic future

#### The opposite is true: It is better to risk boldness than triviality

### Planning is inflexible, stay "lean"
#### The opposite is true: A bad plan is better than no plan

### Improve on competition
#### The opposite is true: Competitive markets destroy profits

### Focus on Product, not Sales
#### The opposite is true: Sales matters just as much as competition

#### Distribution Question

### ((3e001183-e397-4e93-aba8-63c9d8a99226))

## Competition vs. monopoly
### "if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business"

### in reality there are big differences in companies on a scale of to what degree they are a monopoly
#### monopolies lie by defining the market as the union of various markets in order to protect themselves, 

#### undifferentiated businesses, non-monopolies exaggerate by defining the market as the intersection of various smaller markets in order to attract investors

### perfect equilibrium vs. doing something others cannot

### last mover advantage
#### monopoly is only great when it's durable

#### characteristics:
##### proprietary technology, at least 10 times better

##### network effects

##### economies of scale

##### banding

### "start small and monopolise"

### "disruption" is seeing oneself in a competitive way

## Definite Optimism
### "the future will be better if you plan and work to make it better"

### today, there is indefinite optimism with no specific vision for the future

## Power Law for VC
### only very few, targeted investments

### ((212f1ea2-bfd8-4147-8e62-913ca54765e1))

### on jobs: you can only work at one company, maybe working in a small startup which can become a monopoly is better than starting your own one with smaller chances

### ((5b76a639-6cde-4751-b9b1-5d1c19100d6c))

## Founders-Team
### mafia, conspirators on secrets

### ((01667968-7c00-4d35-b523-8f845e2caea8))

### ((090085d8-6003-4224-8713-9e144cdcadb1))

### ((d0520bba-afbc-45c6-a6ff-7d976bf91547))

## Secrets
### ((e62b2d8c-9ca9-4528-926f-218f56da912c))

### ((67d7dc18-5def-430f-9332-529a13987b27))

### 

## Foundations
### Ownership, Possession and Control

### "on the bus or off the bus"
#### part-time doesn't work, only full commitment

#### compensation by shares, not by cash

#### otherwise incentives for short-term actions

## Sales resp. Distribution
### viral marketing vs. complex sales

### sales is hidden, CEO is salesman

### follow a power law: one distribution channel has to work

### 

## Technology means complementary
### AI works best when helping human

### at some easy tasks, e.g. identifying a cat, 4-year-olds are better than computers

### on big data or algorithms, computers outperform human

### cyborg - neurolink

## The Seven Questions every businessman must answer:
### Engineering
#### Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?

### Timing
#### Is now the right time to start your particular business?

### Monopoly
#### Are you starting with a big share of a small market?

### People
#### Do you have the right team?

### Distribution
#### Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?

### Durability
#### Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?

### Secret
#### Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don't see?

## The Natural vs the artificially created
### nature: more complexity?
#### e.g. biotech

#### trial and error necessary?

### nature: more randomness, more bell curve

### artificial: more power law 

### e.g. people on twitter/online vs. rl/offline
#### twitter is artificial, so power law holds considering amount of tweets and followers per person
##### on mainstream-use, there is a bigger filter bubble than in rl since 90% of tweets are from 10% 

##### searching online is 
###### difficult because of loss of randomness due to power law and additional filters (its easy to hide smth. with one click) 

###### global and easier to find the rare/contrarian positions if the other 90% of tweets are searched

##### does it resemble real life?

#### rl/offline is natural
##### a lot of it is still underlies power law
###### e.g. number of people in cities, power or fame of people

##### but there is more randomness, since nature is more driven by human action which leads to more complexity 
###### e.g. tube-neighbours: few I never travel with, few I travel with very often

###### when modelling, bell curve resp. normal distribution can be used due to accumulation of equally-distributed events

##### there are still bubbles because of where people spend most of the time

##### but it's not as easy to stay inside one due to randomness on tails of bell curve

#### randomness is being tried to be kept out of artificially created environments since it would lead to complexity, which would not be understood
