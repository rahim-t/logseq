## Notes::
### **Yellow Annotations (8/2/2020, 11:28:26 PM)**
#### "Internet companies are known for hiring compulsively, spending wildly, and failing spectacularly. That's not us. We're small (sixteen people as this book goes to press), frugal, and profitable." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=2))

#### "Another common misconception: You need to learn from your mistakes. What do you really learn from mistakes? You might learn what not to do again, but how valuable is that? You still don't know what you should do next. Contrast that with learning from your successes. Success gives you real ammunition. When something succeeds, you know what worked--and you can do it again. And the next time, you'll probably do it even better. Failure is not a prerequisite for success. A Harvard Business School study found already-successful entrepreneurs are far more likely to succeed again (the success rate for their future companies is 34 percent). But entrepreneurs whose companies failed the first time had almost the same follow-on success rate as people starting a company for the first time: just 23 percent. People who failed before have the same amount of success as people who have never tried at all.* Success is the experience that actually counts. That shouldn't be a surprise: It's exactly how nature works. Evolution doesn't linger on past failures, it's always building upon what worked. So should you." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=8))

#### "The timing of long-range plans is screwed up too. You have the most information when you're doing something, not before you've done it. Yet when do you write a plan? Usually it's before you've even begun. That's the worst time to make a big decision." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=9))

#### "If you write a big plan, you'll most likely never look at it anyway. Plans more than a few pages long just wind up as fossils in your file cabinet. Give up on the guesswork. Decide what you're going to do this week, not this year. Figure out the next most important thing and do that. Make decisions right before you do something, not far in advance." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=9))

#### "Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=9))

#### "Maybe the right size for your company is five people. Maybe it's forty. Maybe it's two hundred. Or maybe it's just you and a laptop. Don't make assumptions about how big you should be ahead of time. Grow slow and see what feels right--premature hiring is the death of many companies. And avoid huge growth spurts too--they can cause you to skip right over your appropriate size. […] once you get big, it's really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing the entire way you do business." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=11))

#### "Workaholics wind up creating more problems than they solve. First off, working like that just isn't sustainable over time. When the burnout crash comes--and it will--it'll hit that much harder. Workaholics miss the point, too. They try to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at them. They try to make up for intellectual laziness with brute force. This results in inelegant solutions. They even create crises. They don't look for ways to be more efficient because they actually like working overtime. They enjoy feeling like heroes. They create problems (often unwittingly) just so they can get off on working more." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=12))

#### "Let's retire the term entrepreneur. It's outdated and loaded with baggage. It smells like a members-only club. Everyone should be encouraged to start his own business, not just some rare breed that self-identifies as entrepreneurs. There's a new group of people out there starting businesses. They're turning profits yet never think of themselves as entrepreneurs. A lot of them don't even think of themselves as business owners. They are just doing what they love on their own terms and getting paid for it. So let's replace the fancy-sounding word with something a bit more down-to-earth. Instead of entrepreneurs, let's just call them starters." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=13))

#### "At 37signals, we build products we need to run our own business." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=16))

#### "We all have that one friend who says, "I had the idea for eBay. If only I had acted on it, I'd be a billionaire!" That logic is pathetic and delusional. Having the idea for eBay has nothing to do with actually creating eBay. What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan. Think your idea's that valuable? Then go try to sell it and see what you get for it. Not much is probably the answer." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:17](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=17))

#### "Lots of people hate us because our products do less than the competition's. They're insulted when we refuse to include their pet feature. But we're just as proud of what our products don't do as we are of what they do. We design them to be simple because we believe most software is too complex: too many features, too many buttons, too much confusion." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:20](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=20))

#### "There's a world of difference between truly standing for something and having a mission statement that says you stand for something." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=21))

#### "It's like when you're on hold and a recorded voice comes on telling you how much the company values you as a customer. […] just say nothing. But don't give me an automated voice that's telling me how much you care about me. It's a robot. I know the difference between genuine affection and a robot that's programmed to say nice things." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=22))

#### "We're in a service economy now. Service businesses (e.g., consultants, software companies, wedding planners, graphic designers, and hundreds of others) don't require much to get going. If you're running a business like that, avoid outside funding." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=23))

#### "You give up control. When you turn to outsiders for funding, you have to answer to them too. That's fine at first, when everyone agrees. […] "Cashing out" begins to trump building a quality business. Investors want their money back--and quickly (usually three to five years). […] Spending other people's money is addictive." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=24))

#### "When you're just beginning, you have no leverage. That's a terrible time to enter into any financial transaction. Customers move down the totem pole. You wind up building what investors want instead of what customers want. Raising money is incredibly distracting." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=24))

#### "Ah, the startup. It's a special breed of company that gets a lot of attention (especially in the tech world). The start up is a magical place. It's a place where expenses are someone else's problem. It's a place where that pesky thing called revenue is never an issue. It's a place where you can spend other people's money until you figure out a way to make your own. It's a place where the laws of business physics don't apply. The problem with this magical place is it's a fairy tale." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=27))

#### "Anyone who takes a "we'll figure out how to profit in the future" attitude to business is being ridiculous. That's like building a rocket ship but starting off by saying, "Let's pretend gravity doesn't exist." A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby. […] Actual businesses worry about profit from day one." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=28))

#### "you often hear about business owners who sell out, retire for six months, and then get back in the game. They miss the thing they gave away. And usually, they're back with a business that isn't nearly as good as their first." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=29))

#### "the more massive an object, the more energy required to change its direction. It's as true in the business world as it is in the physical world. Mass is increased by ... Long-term contracts Excess staff Permanent decisions Meetings Thick process Inventory (physical or mental) Hardware, software, and technology lock-ins Long-term road maps Office politics Avoid these things whenever you can. That way, you'll be able to change direction easily. The more expensive it is to make a change, the less likely you are to make it." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=30))

#### ""I don't have enough time/money/people/experience." Stop whining. Less is a good thing. Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do with what you've got. There's no room for waste. And that forces you to be creative. […] Writers use constraints to force creativity all the time." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=31))

#### "Southwest--unlike most other airlines, which fly multiple aircraft models--flies only Boeing 737s. As a result, every Southwest pilot, flight attendant, and ground-crew member can work any flight. Plus, all of Southwest's parts fit all of its planes. All that means lower costs and a business that's easier to run." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=31))

#### "When we were building Basecamp, we had plenty of limitations. We had a design firm to run with existing client work, a seven-hour time difference between principals (David was doing the programming in Denmark, the rest of us were in the States), a small team, and no outside funding. These constraints forced us to keep the product simple." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=31))

#### "We make sure to have only one or two people working on a product at a time. And we always keep features to a minimum." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=31))

#### "Whenever you can, swap "Let's think about it" for "Let's decide on it." Commit to making decisions. Don't wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward. You want to get into the rhythm of making choices. When you get in that flow of making decision after decision, you build momentum and boost morale. Decisions are progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can't build on top of "We'll decide later," but you can build on top of "Done." The problem comes when you postpone decisions in the hope that a perfect answer will come to you later. It won't." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=36))

#### "Watch chef Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and you'll see a pattern. The menus at failing restaurants offer too many dishes. The owners think making every dish under the sun will broaden the appeal of the restaurant. Instead it makes for crappy food (and creates inventory headaches). That's why Ramsay's first step is nearly always to trim the menu, usually from thirty-plus dishes to around ten. Think about that. Improving the current menu doesn't come first. Trimming it down comes first. Then he polishes what's left." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=39))

#### "The core of your business should be built around things that won't change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now. Those are the things you should invest in. […] For 37signals, things like speed, simplicity, ease of use, and clarity are our focus. […] fashion fades away. When you focus on permanent features, you're in bed with things that never go out of style." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=41))

#### "It's tempting for people to obsess over tools instead of what they're going to do with those tools. You know the type: Designers who use an avalanche of funky typefaces and fancy Photoshop filters but don't have anything to say. Amateur photographers who want to debate film versus digital endlessly instead of focusing on what actually makes a photograph great. […] People use equipment as a crutch. They don't want to put in the hours on the driving range so they spend a ton in the pro shop. They're looking for a shortcut." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=42))

#### "Think about it this way: If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out?" ([Fried and Hansson 2010:45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=45))

#### "When we launched Basecamp, we didn't even have the ability to bill customers! Because the product billed in monthly cycles, we knew we had a thirty-day gap to figure it out." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:46](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=46))

#### "The business world is littered with dead documents that do nothing but waste people's time. Reports no one reads, diagrams no one looks at, and specs that never resemble the finished product. These things take forever to make but only seconds to forget. If you need to explain something, try getting real with it. Instead of describing what something looks like, draw it. Instead of explaining what something sounds like, hum it. Do everything you can to remove layers of abstraction. The problem with abstractions (like reports and documents) is that they create illusions of agreement. A hundred people can read the same words, but in their heads, they're imagining a hundred different things." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:47](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=47))

#### "You can set up a rule at work that half the day is set aside for alone time. Decree that from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., people can't talk to each other (except during lunch). Or make the first or last half of the day your alone-time period. Or instead of casual Fridays, try no-talk Thursdays. Just make sure this period is unbroken in order to avoid productivity-zapping interruptions." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=51))

#### "the true cost of meetings is staggering. Let's say you're going to schedule a meeting that lasts one hour, and you invite ten people to attend. That's actually a ten-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting. You're trading ten hours of productivity for one hour of meeting time." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=52))

#### "Set a timer. When it rings, meeting's over. Period. Invite as few people as possible. Always have a clear agenda. Begin with a specific problem. Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes. End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=53))

#### "The way you build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on to the next thing. No one likes to be stuck on an endless project with no finish line in sight. Being in the trenches for nine months and not having anything to show for it is a real buzzkill." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=55))

#### "If you absolutely have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm. Small victories let you celebrate and release good news." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=55))

#### "A lot of times it's better to be a quitter than a hero. For example, let's say you think a task can be done in two hours. But four hours into it, you're still only a quarter of the way done. The natural instinct is to think, "But I can't give up now, I've already spent four hours on this!" So you go into hero mode." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=56))

#### "if anything takes one of us longer than two weeks, we've got to bring other people in to take a look. They might not do any work on the task, but at least they can review it quickly and give their two cents. Sometimes an obvious solution is staring you right in the face, but you can't even see it. Keep in mind that the obvious solution might very well be quitting." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=57))

#### "Don't prioritize with numbers or labels. Avoid saying, "This is high priority, this is low priority." Likewise, don't say, "This is a three, this is a two, this is a one, this is a three," etc. Do that and you'll almost always end up with a ton of really high-priority things. That's not really prioritizing. Instead, prioritize visually. Put the most important thing at the top." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:61](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=61))

#### "make choices that are small enough that they're effectively temporary. When you make tiny decisions, you can't make big mistakes. These small decisions mean you can afford to change." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=62))

#### "it's tempting to try to build a business by being a copycat. That's a formula for failure, though. The problem with this sort of copying is it skips understanding--and understanding is how you grow. You have to understand why something works or why something is the way it is. When you just copy and paste, you miss that. You just repurpose the last layer instead of understanding all the layers underneath." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=63))

#### "If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you'll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers. […] Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers, too. Taking a stand always stands out. People get stoked by conflict. They take sides. Passions are ignited. And that's a good way to get people to take notice." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:67](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=67))

#### "Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition. Instead of one-upping, try one-downing. Instead of outdoing, try underdoing. […] If you're planning to build "the iPod killer" or "the next Pokemon," you're already dead. You're allowing the competition to set the parameters. You're not going to out-Apple Apple." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:70](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=70))

#### "We'd rather our customers grow out of our products eventually than never be able to grow into them in the first place. Adding power-user features to satisfy some can intimidate those who aren't on board yet. Scaring away new customers is worse than losing old customers. When you let customers outgrow you, you'll most likely wind up with a product that's basic--and that's fine. Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There's an endless supply of customers who need exactly that." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:73](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=73))

#### "The enthusiasm you have for a new idea is not an accurate indicator of its true worth. What seems like a sure-fire hit right now often gets downgraded to just a "nice to have" by morning. And "nice to have" isn't worth putting everything else on hold. We have ideas for new features all the time. […] let your latest grand ideas cool off for a while first. By all means, have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don't act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their actual priority with a calm mind." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:74](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=74))

#### "an in-store-good product. That's a product you're more excited about in the store than you are after you've actually used it. Smart companies make the opposite: something that's at-home good. When you get the product home, you're actually more impressed with it than you were at the store." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:75](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=75))

#### "Being great at a few things often doesn't look all that flashy from afar. That's OK. You're aiming for a long-term relationship, not a one-night stand." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=76))

#### "How should you keep track of what customers want? Don't. Listen, but then forget what people said. […] The requests that really matter are the ones you'll hear over and over. After a while, you won't be able to forget them. Your customers will be your memory." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:76](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=76))

#### "Being obscure is a great position to be in. Be happy you're in the shadows. Use this time to make mistakes without the whole world hearing about them. […] Obscurity helps protect your ego and preserve your confidence." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:77](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=77))

#### "When you build an audience, you don't have to buy people's attention--they give it to you. This is a huge advantage. So build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos--whatever. Share information that's valuable and you'll slowly but surely build a loyal audience." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:79](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=79))

#### "Teach and you'll form a bond you just don't get from traditional marketing tactics. […] Earning their loyalty by teaching them forms a whole different connection. They'll trust you more. They'll respect you more. Even if they don't use your product, they can still be your fans. Teaching is something individuals and small companies can do that bigger competitors can't. Big companies can afford a Super Bowl ad; you can't. But you can afford to teach, and that's something they'll never do, because big companies are obsessed with secrecy. Everything at those places has to get filtered through a lawyer and go through layers of red tape. Teaching is your chance to outmaneuver them." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:81](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=81))

#### "As a business owner, you should share everything you know too. This is anathema to most in the business world. Businesses are usually paranoid and secretive. […] So emulate famous chefs. They cook, so they write cookbooks." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:82](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=82))

#### "Emulate drug dealers. Make your product so good, so addictive, so "can't miss" that giving customers a small, free taste makes them come back with cash in hand. This will force you to make something about your product bite-size. You want an easily digestible introduction to what you sell." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:88](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=88))

#### "Accounting is a department. Marketing isn't. Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365. Just as you cannot not communicate, you cannot not market" ([Fried and Hansson 2010:89](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=89))

#### "Never hire anyone to do a job until you've tried to do it yourself first. That way, you'll understand the nature of the work." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:91](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=91))

#### "Don't hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain. Always ask yourself: What if we don't hire anyone? […] The right time to hire is when there's more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time. There should be things you can't do anymore. You should notice the quality level slipping. That's when you're hurting. And that's when it's time to hire, not earlier." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:93](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=93))

#### "Some companies are addicted to hiring. Some even hire when they aren't hiring. They'll hear about someone great and invent a position or title just to lure them in. And there they'll sit--parked in a position that doesn't matter, doing work that isn't important. Pass on hiring people you don't need, even if you think that person's a great catch. […] You'll be doing your company more harm than good if you bring in talented people who have nothing important to do. Problems start when you have more people than you need. You start inventing work to keep everyone busy. Artificial work leads to artificial projects. And those artificial projects lead to real costs and complexity." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:94](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=94))

#### "There's surprisingly little difference between a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference comes from the individual's dedication, personality, and intelligence." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=98))

#### "Ninety percent of CEOs currently heading the top five hundred American companies did not receive undergraduate degrees from Ivy League colleges." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:98](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=98))

#### "When you get out of school, you have to unlearn so much of the way they teach you to write there. Some of the misguided lessons you learn in academia: The longer a document is, the more it matters. Stiff, formal tone is better than being conversational. Using big words is impressive. You need to write a certain number of words or pages to make a point. The format matters as much (or more) than the content of what you write." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:99](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=99))

#### "If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. It doesn't matter if that person is a marketer, salesperson, designer, programmer, or whatever; their writing skills will pay off. […] Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:101](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=101))

#### "Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service. It's amazing how much that can defuse a bad situation and turn it into a good one." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:107](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=107))

#### "Artificial culture is paint. Real culture is patina. You don't create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don't have a culture. Culture is the byproduct of consistent behavior." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:114](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=114))

#### "No one sets out to create a bureaucracy. They sneak up on companies slowly. They are created one policy--one scar--at a time. So don't scar on the first cut. Don't create a policy because one person did something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over again." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:120](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=120))

#### "There are four-letter words you should never use in business. […] They're need, must, can't, easy, just, only, and fast." ([Fried and Hansson 2010:122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JMMDWFVW?page=122))
