#### "please don't create your reputation system as if it is a monetary system. You do not spend or trade reputation. Once you earn it, it is yours. [...] Reputation currencies are predicated on continuity of identity. They make no sense without the ability to stay tethered to an identity." ([Brock 2019:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSCPRF4H?page=1))

#### "Reputation, by its very nature, comes into being one of two ways1. It's spoken into being from nothing by declaration2. It's derived from visible indicators such as measurable performance of actions

#### [...] Often reputation currencies are only able to be issued by virtue of a relationship or some kind of expertise or authority. And in this case, that's exactly how you want them to work. I should only be able to give you an eBay rating, if I've done an eBay transaction with you. I should only be able to certify your product as safe, if I know how to test it and what the certification requirements are." ([Brock 2019:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSCPRF4H?page=2))

#### "It is totally valid, however, for reputation systems to have a valid lifetime after which they expire. [...] You may even want moving windows on web site reputations that are connected to metrics of activity in the last year or six months, so that the currency is more relevant to current levels of performance rather than some historical hall of fame. [...] There are so many ways that different types of currencies can be woven together to create powerful connections and reinforcing relationships. [...] I can literally "lend" credibility to someone or something by vouching for them. In this case, I am extending some of your belief in me by virtue of my reputation toward establishing confidence in someone else. A thorough implementation of a reputation system probably ought to include an explicit capacity to do this. If I vouch for someone, it should NOT be like spending reputation like lowering my balance, however, there could be a consequence, whether positive or negative, to my reputation. [...] Unlike a bank account balance, reputation is typically not one dimensional. It's not just a general good/bad. Reputation is contextual and multi-faceted." ([Brock 2019:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSCPRF4H?page=3))

#### "Instead of a single unscaled total of positive or negative feedback points, think of how much more useful it would be to know these things, most of which can be tracked from system activity rather than end-user feedback:

#### Sample Reputation for an eBay Seller

#### How long account has been active, & total # sales
% Successful sales (# delivered sales / # total sales)
Avg. days to receive item (from shipping tracking data)
Avg. Rating (1-5) received for "as advertised"
% of transactions requiring problem resolution


#### Sample Reputation for an eBay Buyer

#### How long account has been active & total # bids won
% Successful Purchases (# bids paid / # bids won)
Avg. time to payment (in hours)
Avg. Rating (1-5) given for "as advertised"
% of transactions requiring problem resolution


#### [...] it's a heck of a lot better than the "feedback extortion" pattern that currently exists" ([Brock 2019:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSCPRF4H?page=4))

#### "Using scales people understand, like percentages, percentiles, number of days to receive purchase, 5 star rating, etc. is necessary for reputation to provide any meaning. [...] There are many great ways for reputation currencies and monetary currencies to interact with each other, but please, do not make the rookie mistake of thinking they should be collapsed into a single currency. In fact, if you want to preserve dimensions of value that your community cares about when transacting with each other, you should probably expect to use more than just two currencies." ([Brock 2019:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XSCPRF4H?page=5))
