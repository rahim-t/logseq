### Type:: [[Book]]

### Abstract::
#### From the New York Times columnist and bestselling author of Bad Religion, a powerful portrait of how our turbulent age is defined by dark forces seemingly beyond our control Today the Western world seems to be in crisis. But beneath our social media frenzy and reality television politics, the deeper reality is one of drift, repetition, and dead ends. The Decadent Society explains what happens when a rich and powerful society ceases advancing—how the combination of wealth and technological proficiency with economic stagnation, political stalemates, cultural exhaustion, and demographic decline creates a strange kind of “sustainable decadence,” a civilizational languor that could endure for longer than we think. Ranging from our grounded space shuttles to our Silicon Valley villains, from our blandly recycled film and television—a new Star Wars saga, another Star Trek series, the fifth Terminator sequel—to the escapism we’re furiously chasing through drug use and virtual reality, Ross Douthat argues that many of today’s discontents and derangements reflect a sense of futility and disappointment—a feeling that the future was not what was promised, that the frontiers have all been closed, and that the paths forward lead only to the grave. In this environment we fear catastrophe, but in a certain way we also pine for it—because the alternative is to accept that we are permanently decadent: aging, comfortable and stuck, cut off from the past and no longer confident in the future, spurning both memory and ambition while we wait for some saving innovation or revelations, growing old unhappily together in the glowing light of tiny screens. Correcting both optimists who insist that we’re just growing richer and happier with every passing year and pessimists who expect collapse any moment, Douthat provides an enlightening diagnosis of the modern condition—how we got here, how long our age of frustration might last, and how, whether in renaissance or catastrophe, our decadence might ultimately end.

#### "Decadence, deployed usefully, refers to economic stagnation, institutional decay, and cultural and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development. It describes a situation in which repetition is more the norm than innovation; in which sclerosis afflicts public institutions and private enterprises alike; in which intellectual life seems to go in circles; in which new developments in science, new exploratory projects, underdeliver compared with what people recently expected. And, crucially, the stagnation and decay are often a direct consequence of previous development. The decadent society is, by definition, a victim of its own significant success. [...] the goal is to define decadence as something more specific than just any social or moral trend that you dislike." ([Douthat 2020:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=13))

#### "to convince you that our society is, indeed, decadent; that my definition actually applies to the contemporary West over the last two generations and may apply soon to all the societies that are currently catching up to Europe and North America and East Asia." ([Douthat 2020:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=14))

#### "the speed with which we experience events has quickened, the speed of actual change has not." ([Douthat 2020:15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=15))

#### "So it sits there, widely regarded as one of the defining success stories of the Internet era, a unicorn unlike any other, with billions in losses and a plan to become profitable that involves vague promises to somehow monetize all its user data and a specific promise that its investment in a different new technology— the self-driving car, much ballyhooed but as yet not exactly real—will square the circle and make the math add up. That's the story of Uber—so far. It isn't a pure Instagram fantasy like the Fyre Festival or a naked fraud like Theranos; it managed to go public and maintain its outsize valuation, unlike its fellow money-losing unicorn WeWork [...]. like them, it is, for now, an example of a major twenty-first-century company invented entirely out of surplus, less economically efficient so far than the rivals it is supposed to leapfrog, sustained by investors who believe its promises in defiance of the existing evidence, floated by the hope that with enough money and market share, you can will a profitable company into existence, and goldwashed by an "Internet company" identity that obscures the weakness of its real-world fundamentals." ([Douthat 2020:22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=22))

#### "when an extraordinarily rich society can't find enough new ideas that justify investing all its stockpiled wealth, and ends up choosing between hoarding cash in mattresses or playing a kind of let's-pretend instead. [...] let's-pretendism—by technologies that have almost arrived, business models that are on their way to profitability, by runways that go on and go on without ever achieving liftoff." ([Douthat 2020:23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=23))

#### "The peak income year of 2017 wasn't the top of a long climb but just a return to a previous high: that $60,000 median income barely exceeded the median income in the previous peak year of 2007, which in turn barely exceeded the peak of 1999. In other words, in sixteen out of the eighteen years between the turn of the millennium and the Trump presidency, the average American family earned less market income—a lot less, in the bad years—than in the last year of the Clinton presidency. [...] it had taken seventeen years to return to the unemployment rate of 1999, neither wage growth nor productivity growth had returned to the 1990s pace, and the workforce participation rate [...] was almost 4 percentage points lower than it had been at the turn of the millennium—a jobs gap, relative to the Clinton era, that represented almost ten million additional nonworking Americans. Among men, the gap was particularly stark: the 11 percent of prime-age men who weren't working in 2018 was the highest rate since the Great Depression." ([Douthat 2020:24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=24))

#### "hourly wages peaked in the early 1970s and dipped thereafter, household income growth began to slow, the larger economy experienced so-called stagflation and three sharp recessions under Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan." ([Douthat 2020:25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=25))

#### "In response to these post-JFK economic disappointments, policy makers of both political parties embraced the policy mix that now gets labeled "neoliberalism": lower taxes and deregulation, free trade and anti-inflationary monetary policy. By the late 1990s, this response seemed to have been somewhat effective: household wealth was growing, workforce participation climbed as more and more women entered the labor force, overall growth rates were pushing back up toward 4 percent, wages and productivity were rising. But then the dot-com bubble burst, and thereafter straightforward stagnation became the order of the day, with weak recoveries, weak household income growth, declining productivity and household wealth, and far more workforce dropouts than before." ([Douthat 2020:25f](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=25))

#### "the downshift toward stagnation since the 1970s has been shared across the developed world." ([Douthat 2020:26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=26))

#### "A 2019 paper by three economists titled "How the Wealth Was Won" found that 54 percent of the growth of US companies' stock market value reflected "a reallocation of rents to shareholders in a decelerating economy," while actual economic growth accounted for just 24 percent. "From 1952 to 1988, less than half as much wealth was created" in the stock market, the authors note, "but economic growth accounted for 92 percent of it."" ([Douthat 2020:27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=27))

#### "the supposed rise of an Internet-enabled "gig economy" is something of a myth. (Between 2005 and 2018, a Bureau of Labor Statistics study found, the increase in solo work driven by companies such as Uber was exceeded by declines in other kinds of freelancing.) [...] since the Great Recession [...] the US birthrate [...] has descended rapidly, converging with the wealthy world's general below-replacement norm." ([Douthat 2020:28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=28))

#### "the general principle that open markets have more winners than losers led policy makers to assume that this would necessarily happen, and to overestimate how quickly communities affected by outsourcing would recover and how swiftly other sectors of the economy would compensate." ([Douthat 2020:29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=29))

#### "David Autor has argued persuasively that the "China shock"—the dramatic offshoring that followed Beijing's entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001— inflicted more economic damage on working-class communities in the United States than many experts anticipated, without generating the compensating growth and job creation expected elsewhere. This is not a knockdown case against free trade, just a case against overconfidence in its incautious application." ([Douthat 2020:29f](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=29))

#### "program of permanent upper-bracket tax cutting, as practiced by America's Republican Party, won't produce the hoped-for spillover effects among the bottom 95 percent. [...] It's possible that a program of deficit reduction and tight money that makes sense when inflation is galloping doesn't make sense when we're closer to deflation, that countries sometimes need a loose monetary policy to fight stagnation, and having a financial overclass too fixated on the perils of a for-now imaginary inflation is a recipe for permanently lower growth. [...] The age of stagnation, in this theory, is the fruit of what Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Institute and Steven Teles of Johns Hopkins University describe as a "captured economy," in which everything from land-use rules, to exclusionary zoning, to occupational licensing, to ever-expanding intellectual-property protections, to corporate subsidies and tax breaks all converge to create an system that's basically the worst of socialism and the worst of capitalism conjoined—plutocratic and sclerotic, overregulated and undertaxed, with an upper class enriching itself off rents rather than innovation and a service class that can't advance beyond its station." ([Douthat 2020:30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=30))

#### "Piketty and his admirers are hardest on the superrich, blaming their political influence and essential selfishness for foiling necessary large-scale redistribution, while libertarian antirentiers are more likely to argue that the richest of the rich still generally rise on their own merits (think Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett), while it's the mass upper class that's really guilty of what the Brookings Institution's Richard Reeves calls "dream hoarding": the combined effects of inherited wealth, educational requirements, real estate prices, and tax breaks that essentially reproduce privilege from one generation to the next. But there is a basic common ground here, a shared left-and-libertarian critique of consolidation and self-dealing that clearly describes some essential features of our long deceleration." ([Douthat 2020:31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=31))

#### "if you're an outsider to, say, Silicon Valley, you can't "go West" to pursue the opportunities it offers if you can't afford to live and work there." ([Douthat 2020:32](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=32))

#### "we are, in effect, using our extraordinary wealth to permanently prop up a weak private-sector economy rather than enjoying a strong private-sector economy that increases our extraordinary wealth." ([Douthat 2020:34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=34))

#### "In the United States, literacy rates for white students peaked in the 1970s and have slipped since." ([Douthat 2020:35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=35))

#### "the fact that birthrates plunge during recessions—as they did in an extreme way during the Great Recession—suggests that personal finances play a major role in fertility decisions; hence the possibility that the economic stagnation discussed in the last chapter, and especially stagnation in working-class incomes, explains some of the recent birthrate drop. But the stagnation hypothesis seems to cut against the broader historical experience of the modern West, since people used to have large families while living in what seems to modern people like the most squalid and impossible conditions, and decades and centuries of economic growth— including the recent recovery in the United States—have been accompanied by general fertility declines. In other words, our great wealth relative to the human past discourages fertility, but then setbacks and disappointment within that wealthy context discourages it further still. [...] A number of studies have suggested that Europe's more generous safety net modestly discourages people from having large families, because larger welfare states require higher taxes on potential parents and reduce the incentive to have multiple kids to take care of you in your old age. Fifteen or twenty years ago, this evidence was cited to explain why the United States still had higher birthrates than France or Germany [...]. American birthrates have converged with those of many northern European countries—and some of those countries have higher birthrates than European countries with weaker welfare states." ([Douthat 2020:50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=50))

#### "countries like South Korea and Singapore have used both policy and propaganda to little avail as their fertility rates have dropped toward half or less than half replacement level. And even in France and Sweden, the high birthrate is partially an artifact of those countries' relative openness to immigration; in social democratic Finland, by contrast, a vigorous program to support families, complete with the famous "baby box" that doubles as a cradle, sent to every expecting mother, has done little to prevent the number of Finnish babies from scraping a depth not seen since a dreadful famine in the 1860s. [...] the most child-free cities in the West are generally places associated with a maximalist social liberalism—San Francisco, Stockholm, Seattle. [...] Sweden is much more secular than Poland, but the Swedes overall have more kids than the Poles. Northern Europe is more secular than southern Europe, but birthrates in Spain and Greece are lower than in Great Britain or much of Scandinavia. [...] there may be kind of a trap for societies, like Italy and Japan, that maintain certain traditionalist gender norms while welcoming (or hustling) women into the workforce—almost as if when women are expected to play traditional homemaker roles and also work full-time, they go on a kind of reproductive strike." ([Douthat 2020:51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=51))

#### "Projections in the 1960s suggested that developed-world fertility would settle around 2.2 children per woman. Instead it appears to be settling around 1.7, and even that may be optimistic. Yet the desired family size in the Western world is still closer to 2.5 children, so it's not that everybody suddenly wants to have just one kid. Women want as many children as men, so it's not just a question of female preferences dictating things now that feminism has enabled them to be expressed. [...] The Israeli fertility rate in 1985 was 2.7 births per woman; today, in a still-richer country, the rate stands at 3.1. Some of this can be explained as a case study in how religiosity drives fertility, given both the strength of the ultraorthodox community in Israel and the fact that from the 1970s onward, Israel has welcomed a more devout and conservative type of immigrant than have most Western countries. But the Israeli birthrate has remained high, and even climbed higher, among secular Israelis as well. [...] fecundity increases with the felt stakes of ordinary life, and that Israel's distinctive identity, history, and geopolitical position—perpetually threatened, perpetually mobilized—creates very different attitudes toward the self-sacrifice involved in parenthood than the less existentially shadowed culture of other rich societies." ([Douthat 2020:52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=52))

#### "the world of the postwar baby boom, which was shaped not only by the temporary religious revival of the late 1940s but also by the solidarity forged in wartime, the need (in Europe) to rebuild a shattered civilization, and the apocalyptic threat of nuclear war. But the end of that period of exceptionalism, and the fertility collapse of the late 1960s and 1970s that followed, also points to another plausible explanation for the depths that Western fertility is scraping: the fact that since the sexual revolution, men and women seem to be having more and more trouble successfully and permanently pairing off." ([Douthat 2020:53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=53))

#### "people reacted to the social revolutions of the 1960s first by marrying less and divorcing more and having fewer children, more of whom were born outside of wedlock, and then eventually by marrying much less, having many fewer children, and even—in trends from the last two decades—having less sex, period. This last, perhaps most startling trend shows up in studies all across the developed world, from Britain and Germany, to East Asia, to the United States, where the decline correlates with the rise of the Internet, the iPhone, and all the virtual alternatives to old-fashioned copulation. In low-fertility Japan, a recent study from the Family Planning Agency found that 45 percent of women ages sixteen to twenty-four and a quarter of men "were not interested in or despised sexual contact." In low-birthrate Finland, a 2015 study compiled evidence of "increasing lack of sexual desire, decreasing frequency of sexual intercourse," and a decline in the frequency of female orgasms since the 1970s and 1990s. Maybe the decline of sex and baby-making as well as marriage, the substitution of masturbation for intercourse and asexuality for both, just reflects the free choices of a free people, to be celebrated rather than deplored. But that blithe assessment ignores the widening gap between what most people still say they want—relationships, marriage, children—and their growing inability to find those partners and conceive those children." ([Douthat 2020:53f](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=53))

#### "Almost inevitably, then, society with fewer babies will be less dynamic and more stratified, which makes population decline a case study in how decadence overtakes a civilization, because it's an example of how growth and development can create the necessary preconditions for cultural trends (in this case, toward sexual individualism, postfamilialism, childbearing delayed that becomes childbearing foregone) that in turn make further development less likely by undercutting the very forces (youth, risk taking, dynamism) necessary for continued growth. It's a sign of civilization's development, almost by definition, when adults have a wider range of potential identities than "mother" and "father" available to them, and the gradual downward trajectory of birthrates in the modern era has often reflected gains to human welfare: victories over infant mortality, over constant childbearing as an absolute requirement of the marital state, over backbreaking agrarian economies. But when that trajectory crosses over into below-replacement territory, the individual's horizons can only really widen further at the future's eventual expense. Which means that as much as individualism is the fruit of growth, wealth, prosperity, and achievement, in our own era it also seems to be the seedbed of stagnation." ([Douthat 2020:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=56))

#### "The personal disappointments that come with unfulfilled childbearing aspirations are probably an underappreciated aspect of late-middle-aged unhappiness today. But there's also a more general sociological and psychological consequence of low birthrates, a general impact of smaller family size on how people experience everyday life, their families, friendships, and communities, and—perhaps above all—on the way they think about the future of their society." ([Douthat 2020:56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=56))

#### "fewer brothers and sisters and cousins, more people living for longer and longer stretches on their own. This postfamilialism is associated with carefree singlehood—a long "adultescence." But in an aging society, its most important effects will be felt among older Americans." ([Douthat 2020:57](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=57))

#### "The children born into a low-fertility world have certain obvious advantages: delayed fertility means that their parents have more resources, smaller families mean that each kid gets more parental attention. But at the same time, when they're born to older parents (and especially older fathers, whose sperm quality decays markedly) these kids will be more likely to have developmental disorders and learning disabilities. They will have fewer intimate peers, fewer siblings and cousins, and a weaker network of natural allies and sympathizers as they navigate the trials of adolescence. Their parents will be older when they confront early-adulthood challenges, more likely to become burdens when their progeny are still trying to establish themselves, less active and helpful as grandparents (if they become grandparents at all), more likely to die before their offspring reach middle age." ([Douthat 2020:58](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=58))

#### "In this landscape, the end of middle age seems to be a particular crisis point— the moment when the advantages of solo living can evaporate, when the promise of independence becomes a curse, when the absence or delay of grandchildren removes a reason for optimism and purpose. The grim social indicators of the last twenty years in America, the rising suicide rates and addiction trends and "deaths of despair," are often worst among the late-middle-aged and early-elderly —especially among older and divorced men, who seem unable to confront the prospect of decades of postfamilial existence. Human beings are relational creatures. We depend on community for everyday happiness, and we imagine and encounter the future most intensely through our own progeny, our flesh and blood." ([Douthat 2020:58f](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=58))

#### "Sudden crises can have a profound effect: if you have just one child or grandchild (or your neighbor or friend has just one), and he or she dies or gets wounded in a foreign war, gets knocked into bankruptcy or foreclosure by a major recession, or ends up addicted, jailed, or dead during the opioid epidemic, your perspective on the future can be altered more dramatically than someone whose social web is larger, whose ties to the future expand instead of narrow." ([Douthat 2020:59](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=59))

#### "elites in both the United States and Europe have embraced mass immigration as a solution for the economic problems associated with sterility." ([Douthat 2020:60](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=60))

#### "as a technocratic solution to the economic problems created by postfamilialism, mass immigration is a double-edged sword. It replaces some of the missing workers but exacerbates intergenerational alienation and native-immigrant friction because it heightens precisely the anxieties about inheritance and loss that below-replacement fertility is heightening already. It delivers the promise of a more dynamic future, potentially, than the future promised by low birthrates, but for natives who are aging and whose communities aren't thriving, it also suggests the benefits of that imagined future belong increasingly to people who seem culturally alien, to inheritors who aren't your natural heirs, to other people's children and grandchildren rather than the dwindling numbers of your own. So much of the populism that's been on the march in the United States and Europe (but not so much in Japan and South Korea, which, not coincidentally, have looked more to robots than to immigrants to address their demographic problems) is rooted in the way this sentiment—a mix of racism and xenophobia and the very human, not-at-all-deplorable tendency to identify and care for one's own—intertwines with anxieties created by economic stagnation and social fragmentation." ([Douthat 2020:60f](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=60))

#### "the politics of declining birthrates leading to support for a kind of soft authoritarianism, with a state that does more to protect you through the life cycle and in old age, with a more heavily regulated economy, plus a more vigorous assertion of national identity as a substitute for attenuated familial identities—but for all this to happen without the political upheavals and outright violence that we saw when society was younger, more active, and hormonal. Such soft authoritarianism might, in its more effective form, build on tendencies evident in Eastern European and even Scandinavian politics. In a more chaotic form, it might follow the example of the Trump administration, offering a form of cable news entertainment for its supporters, by turns cruel and incompetent but mostly performative and virtual and inspiring performative and virtual responses, while in the real world people keep doddering through the normal motions of their lives." ([Douthat 2020:62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=62))

#### "The society of Children of Men isn't collapsing into chaos; it's just settling into the senility of repetition, content to live despairingly but peaceably, paying down, for a last few decades, the accumulated capital of its vigorous and vanished past. [...] You would expect stalemate and sclerosis, at the very least, rather than sudden crisis or catastrophe." ([Douthat 2020:63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=63))

#### "The Obama experience began with grand ambition; it ended up illustrating one of Jacques Barzun's lines about a decadent era: that "institutions function painfully" no matter who's in charge. And while the Obama administration's failures weren't extraordinary front-page disasters like the Iraq invasion or the financial crisis, it was their very ordinariness that confirmed the reality of sclerosis—proving that even without a global economic meltdown or a massive intelligence cock-up, even with a team of cool technocrats supposedly taking over for the cowboys and bringing back light and reason, a consistent ineffectuality in American governance is just the way things are. Thus it was ordinary that the Obama White House's technocrats, elected in the aftermath of a disaster created by private interests too intertwined with the public interest to be allowed to fail, presided over a further consolidation of the public and the private, a stronger Washington-Wall Street symbiosis in which banks and corporations were protected but home owners were left to suffer, and not a single important person went to jail. It was ordinary that the White House's pedigreed wonks failed to anticipate the depths of the recession and pivoted to health care in defiance of the public's economy-first mood; ordinary that they designed a health care bill that had to be sold with a flagrant lie about how you could keep your plan no matter what; ordinary that the bill was pushed through in such a legislatively complicated way that its provisions were vulnerable to successive challenges in the courts; ordinary that its online rollout was botched, and the losers' pain drove political backlash that made further legislating difficult. It was ordinary that after expanding the deficit, defensibly, to fight the recession, Obama would then fail to reach a bipartisan agreement to restrain the long-term growth of debt; after all, no major deal combining spending cuts and tax increases has been reached since 1991, twenty-eight years ago and counting. It was likewise ordinary that there wouldn't even be a revenue-neutral tax reform (the last one was in 1985), that there would also be no deal on immigration reform (the last one was in 1986), and that after posturing as a critic of presidential unilateralism, Obama would end up claiming novel powers in an effort to make immigration policy on his own. It was normal that he would do the same on health care and climate policy. It was normal that the day-to-day functioning of the federal system depended on government-by-brinksmanship, with debt-ceiling showdowns and fiscal cliffs and government shutdowns necessary preconditions for even modest deals. Then, too, it was normal that in foreign policy the Obama administration would extend the war in Afghanistan into its second decade without any strategic plan for victory and, after an attempt at withdrawal opened the door to the rise of the Islamic State, extend our presence in Iraq as well. After all, since the 1960s, the United States military has stopped winning wars and turned to simply managing them—toward defeat in the case of our fifteen-year Vietnam disaster; to permanent stalemate in the case of our almost twenty years in Afghanistan; to perpetual occupation in the case of our nearly thirty-year involvement in Iraq. It was also normal that the war where the Obama White House officially avoided both stalemate and occupation, our splendid little intervention in Libya, was actually a bigger disaster overall, with a North African power vacuum and a Europe-shaking migration crisis as its major legacies. And it was entirely normal that the Libyan intervention, like our post-ISIS return to Iraq and our stumblebum attempts to influence the course of the Syrian civil war, lacked any specific congressional authorization, continuing a pattern of congressional abdication in foreign policy and domestic policy alike. It was entirely normal that the White House's chief diplomatic achievements, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accords, also lacked congressional authorization, meaning that they could be rolled back (and were) with the stroke of a successor's pen. And it was, finally, entirely normal that every other Obama initiative—the reset with Russia, the predictable Israel-Palestine push, the "pivot to Asia"—was in tatters by the time he left the White House. Late in Obama's second term, a Brookings Institution scholar set out to analyze "major failures" in recent presidential administrations (with the obvious Iraq and 9/11-related examples, and the handling of Hurricane Katrina and the VA scandal as domestic templates). He found that "government had four failures during Reagan's nal two and a half years (1.6 per year), five during George H. W. Bush's four years (1.2 per year), fourteen during Clinton's eight years (1.8 per year), twenty-five during George W. Bush's eight years (3.1 per year), and sixteen during Obama's first five and a half years (2.9 per year)."" ([Douthat 2020:66ff](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=66))

#### "one can assume that the pace in the Trump administration (with Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, the child-separation disaster at the Mexican border, and the Kurdish-Turkish fiasco as conspicuous case studies) would match the Obama-era rate, with only an inevitable deficit-expanding tax cut to offer as a meaningful legislative achievement, and with Trump's Ukrainian folly leading to the third attempted impeachment in the last fifty years, compared to just one case in the entire prior history of the republic." ([Douthat 2020:68](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=68))

#### "The opposition to the Obama health care bill was obviously ideological, reflecting a clash between libertarian and social democratic principles. But most Americans aren't thoroughgoing libertarians; indeed, even most Tea Partiers weren't thoroughgoing libertarians. The real reason that Obamacare opposition became so fierce, and the debate so toxic, was that the health care system as it exists is as Rauch described government as a whole: a huge sprawl of client populations and powerful interest groups, all of which have a strong financial stake in the existing system, and all of which have spent decades building up the lobbying shops and inner-ring knowledge required to either frustrate or redirect reform. These groups start with the corporate actors that reformers tend to describe as "special interests," such as drug manufacturers and insurance companies— which is why there was no way for the health care reform to advance without the Obama White House buying off Pfizer and appeasing Aetna. But behind Big Pharma and Big Insurance stood a longer line of more sympathetic groups that might stand to lose from health care reform: seniors who receive Medicare and doctors who accept it; the patients and doctors and (above all) hospital networks that seem to overspend on health care and would therefore bear the brunt of cost control; middle-class and not-quite-rich families that don't want their taxes going up; middle-class near-seniors who would be squeezed if they're required to buy age-rated insurance; struggling young people who would be squeezed if they're required to subsidize those fiftysomethings; union members who like the current health insurance tax deduction exactly as it is."

#### "leaving future reformers little choice but to do what Obama ultimately did and rely on inefficient and overly complicated workarounds, disguised or delayed tax increases, and, of course, some simple lies. Buy off some groups, hide the costs from others, promise some losers that they wouldn't really lose, play fast and loose with parliamentary rules when the backlash comes rolling in, and you can win an unpopular policy victory—which, because the reform creates new clients and the system frustrates change, your critics may find themselves unable to reverse even when they reclaim power. I'm being hard on Obama, so it's important to stress that this is what success looks like. The last American president really did expand health insurance coverage, however inefficiently and at however much political cost, and if the health care law has not lived up to the administration's projections, it also hasn't had the budget-busting effects that its critics feared."

#### "At a certain size and scale of state spending and administrative complexity, and after a sufficient period of time has elapsed from the initial founding of the system (whether you date it to the progressive era, or the New Deal era, or the Great Society), sclerosis becomes the default state, interest-group conspiracies the default mode of governance, regulatory capture the default fate of attempted reforms, and any attempt to sweep the money changers from the temple will last, at best, a year or three before they find a way to rush back in. But meanwhile, the voting public, while complicit in this process, also expects the government to act, to do things, to follow through on the promises that politicians inevitably make, or to respond to crises as they arise. This means there is still necessarily action in a sclerotic system; it's just likely to be extraconstitutional, carried out either by the president via executive at or by the portions of government that are insulated from the risks of backlash, the judiciary and the federal bureaucracy. Thus, most modern American policy making, as certain conservative critics predicted long ago, no longer takes place in the branch supposedly charged with making laws. Instead, Congress gratefully abdicates whenever possible, off-loading risk and responsibility to the courts and the White House and the administrative state—either by simple inaction or, in cases where legislation does pass, by punting hard questions to administrative rule makers and to litigation. This leaves the United States with a government that effectively functions via negotiations and power struggles between the judiciary, the Oval Office, and what our current president likes to call the deep state. Which, of course, produces policies that are more arbitrary and opaque and unstable and subject to sudden reversals than legislation forged in democratic deliberation. The political scientist Steven Teles, borrowing from computer science, calls this tendency "kludgeocracy," meaning a system in which every solution is basically "an inelegant patch put in place to solve an unexpected problem and designed to be backward-compatible with the rest of the system." As with computer programming, the pileup of kludges creates "a very complicated program that has no clear organizing principles, is exceedingly difficult to understand, and is subject to crashes.""

#### "The culprits in this account include the Democratic Party reformers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, who broke the power of the party bosses and unwittingly made dealmaking and compromise that much harder; Newt Gingrich, who transformed the early-1990s Republican minority into something much more like a parliamentary party, ideologically zealous and centralized around his leadership; Fox News and talk radio, which ratified this shift by holding Republican politicians to impossible standards of ideological purity; the rise of similar ideological enforcers on the left, from the Bush-era netroots, to MSNBC, to the activist left of the late Obama years; and then the politicians of both parties who saw advantage in consistently breaking the informal norms that kept Washington working, beginning with the Democratic defeat of Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987 and escalating through nomination battles thereafter, all the way to Mitch McConnell's pocket veto of Merrick Garland, the slow death of the libuster, and whatever happens next."

#### "Strikingly, just as political conservatism manifests precisely the vices that conservative intellectuals describe as characteristic of politics under big government, so too does a certain kind of centrism flirt with the strongman temptation that its critique implies we face. I'm thinking here of the kind of self-consciously moderate pundits who compare American government unfavorably to the smooth efficiency of the Beijing Politburo... or the kind of "No Labels" independents who imagine some hybrid of Mike Bloomberg, Elon Musk, and James Mattis emerging to lead America out of polarization... or the not particularly ideological voters who thrill to the idea of a businessman-president who just get things done. If Trump's ascent reflected, in part, the pathologies of political conservatism, he also traded (like Ross Perot before him) on the populist version of this centrism, the sense that both parties are so corrupt that a demagogue who says, "I alone can fix it," is the businessman-caudillo that our gridlocked republic needs."

#### "But the left's framing is too moralistic and deterministic about the deeper past and—oddly—too kind to recent Republican leadership. The GOP did absorb a lot of populist energy in the sixties and seventies, some of it racist and malign. But that kind of absorption is a normal thing in American history and, indeed, a healthy thing: you want populist concerns to be addressed through the major-party system; you want national leaders to be at once responsive and responsible, sifting legitimate concerns from bigotry and addressing them through policy rather than pure tribalism. And between 1970 and 2000, that seemed to generally happen in the GOP: as crime rates fell and welfare was reformed, the racial dog whistles also diminished, and the party seemed to have effectively brought a lot of white voters along to the more color-blind, outreach-oriented conservatism that George W. Bush imagined himself to be pursuing. But what happened thereafter was that the Republican Party's Bush-led establishment (not its populist grassroots) presided over two disasters, the Iraq War and the financial crisis, that were more extreme than the normal gridlock and failure of our recent presidencies, even as diminishing returns from the Reaganite/neoliberal prescription left the economy in a general state of torpor. Then instead of learning, adapting, and repenting, both the Republican Party establishment and the right's media-entertainment complex spent the Obama years alternately riling up and ignoring their own voters, playing the politics-as-entertainment game and then complaining when their base expected them to deliver on their over-the-top sound bites. They became, in effect, the most decadent part of a decadent system, which left them particularly incapable of legislating and deal making and particularly vulnerable to a strongman—or at least the reality-television and Twitter version thereof. The pattern of American politics under that Twitter strongman's presidency has confirmed the reality of sclerosis while also suggesting that the Democrats might be its next victims. The story of the Trump administration to date is one of corrupt weakness, of would-be authoritarianism undone by incompetence, of continued abdication by the legislature and continued negotiation over policy between the courts and the executive, of continued stalemate between incompetent populists and disliked but still resilient elites. Meanwhile, the story of Trump's liberal opposition is one of transformation, half accomplished so far, into an ideological formation, woke progressivism, that mirrors the decadent phase of the conservative movement in its ideological demands and litmus tests, its airless certainties and willful disdain for moderation. Which in turn promises to set up the Democratic Party for its own civil wars, should it ever retake power, between the true believers and an establishment that promises too much and can't deliver—a civil war that would only deepen the larger stalemate in which the left and the right are locked."

#### "We can say that a system that grafts a twentieth-century administrative state onto an eighteenth-century constitutional system was bound to run into difficulties eventually; that a sprawling and ineffective big government and a nihilistic skepticism about government can be dangerously symbiotic with each other; that partisan polarization has contributed to the decay of our political process, and failures unique to the GOP and its leadership have accelerated it. We can also say that this decay exhibits the characteristic features of what I'm calling decadence, in the sense that it's a story of success (the antiquity and long endurance of America's constitutional order, the popularity of the foundational programs of the welfare state) as a precondition for sclerosis; of development (the increasing ideological coherence and even the voter-targeting efficiency of parties and campaigns) leading to gridlock; of a once-effective political order becoming impervious to constructive change. But then, finally, we can say that too much focus on the particularly American aspects of this story is probably a mistake, because as in the economic and demographic realms, you can see a similar decadence at work—albeit on a different timescale—in the nations of western Europe."

Then to that basic unwisdom, the Eurocrats decided to add the common currency, which transformed their union from a merely unpopular and annoying bureaucratic superstructure into something more destructive, especially for the Continent's poorer nations—a Hotel California that offered immediate pleasures upon entry but imposed destructive terms when bad times hit and yet simultaneously made it nearly impossible to leave."

#### "the golden age of television that played out recently on cable, with its antiheroes and gritty takes on classic American genres (the Western in Deadwood, the gangster movie in The Sopranos and its imitators, the detective story/police procedural in The Wire, the office drama in Mad Men) is essentially a small-screen version of the 1970s-era golden age of the Hollywood auteur—the age of Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman, their work impressively imitated but not necessarily reinvented by the smaller screen's auteurs. The fantasy worlds and dystopias of Battlestar Galactica and Game of Thrones and The Handmaid's Tale offer the same "gritty-reboot" treatment to genres that came into vogue forty years ago, when dystopia and nostalgia first conquered the more gee-whiz, optimistic forms of sci-fi.

[...] Jordan Peterson's popular tracts against the dangers of postmodernism are fresh and shocking only if you don't remember the 1980s; if you do, they're mostly a reminder that it's been almost forty years since postmodernism was actually radical and new. More generally, the conservative critique of academic liberalism was distilled in the three decades between William F.

They reflect what Barzun calls the constant "deadlocks of our time". [...] The reason that American conservatives are so persistently nostalgic for the Reagan presidency, now more than thirty years gone, and the reason that liberals remain fascinated with their 1960s-era icons is that so little has changed politically since the upheavals that took place between Jack Kennedy's assassination in '63 and Reagan's '80 victory.

#### "as Miles Klee wrote recently in MEL magazine, "The Internet promised exponential divergence but congealed into another monoculture." When Napster and then iTunes wrecked the record industry, or Amazon "disrupted" the book business, the new landscape did sometimes allow for more amateurs to break through. But it mostly favored name brands and superstars because their brands became more important in the absence of the old middlemen. So the publishing industry now runs more than ever on star power, and it's harder to make a living as a midlist author than before; likewise, the music stars who can dictate terms online and make a fortune touring are still flush, but the medium-power acts—which are also, in many cases, the most artistically interesting—have lost market share and money. The anticreative trends in the movie business are only likely to be heightened if the Internet finally collapses the old theatrical-release business model, leaving a few Netflix/Amazon/Disney content behemoths and their algorithms in charge of which movies get made and delivered to your media device, which classic films get streamed or promoted (hint: not many), which Marvel character gets a movie or which extremely recent animated classic gets a live-action reboot next. The same goes for the competition among art forms for patronage, attention, dollars: movies, music, and television have weathered the transition to the Internet era far better than classical music or ballet or art museums, which have all seen similar superstar effects (New York museums still attract huge crowds; not so much elsewhere) while their audiences generally decline."

Just as online video mostly spreads smut rather than nurturing auteurs, in overthrowing the centrist staleness of the old media, the Internet has mostly given us a bumper crop of hackish crap, of political pornography for the partisan mind, of news coverage whose problem isn't its fakeness so much as its crushing mediocrity."

It is not impossible for genius to flourish under such constraints, but depth becomes a near impossibility.

But the boomers were young during the last great burst of creativity in Western history; the last great surge of mass cultural invention. And the genius of sixties rock and seventies cinema, the importance of feminism, libertarianism, and environmentalism to subsequent events, the stamp left by protoboomers like the Beatles and Bob Dylan and full boomers such as Steven Spielberg and Steve Jobs, is all real, no matter what kind of moral judgment one passes on the era as a whole."

The old men of that world, the father figures to be wrestled with and overcome, were war heroes and giants—literally so in the cases of Lyndon Johnson and Charles de Gaulle. The old forms were still powerful and vital, and so to subvert or overthrow or replace them, the new forms had to be powerful as well. And they were, for a time. The boomer utopianism that now feels rote, dated, and commercialized was a genuine revolution when it first emerged, and it had to feel like a revolution because it was attacking something that still felt confident, rooted, possibly enduring."

In the United States, a team of UCLA researchers surveyed a large population of sex criminals and found that they recalled using less porn than the average male. The desensitizing effect that MacKinnon and many others had predicted showed up in the research too: constant porn use did seem to make normal arousal more challenging for many users; normal sex less immediately attractive.

#### "Then there is the opioid epidemic, which swept across the unhappiest parts of white America without anyone noticing because the drug itself quiets rather than inflames, supplying a gentle euphoria that lets its users simply slip away, day by day and bit by bit, without causing anyone any trouble. It's not that there aren't bursts of violence associated with the opioid trade, or addicts willing to commit murder for a fix. But, generally, Americans have ended up dying in record numbers from opioids without the kind of crime wave or murder spike, without the turbulence and chaos, that accompanied the crack epidemic. As the essayist Andrew Sullivan wrote for New York magazine in 2018, "The drugs now conquering America are downers: they are not the means to engage in life more vividly but to seek a respite from its ordeals." And unlike pot, opioids are antisocial drugs, offering bliss that's best experienced in solitude. Instead of the munchies, they make you indifferent to food; instead of supercharging the libido, they make you indifferent to sex."

#### "Our society doesn't repress youthful lust and aggression so much as it stimulates them safely through video games and smut [...]. From the 1960s onward, conservative critics of a triumphant boomer liberalism predicted that rampant individualism would make society itself dissolve; that fewer fathers and weaker churches and a general hedonistic ethos would mean more crime, more violence, more overt social breakdown. And Western trends from about 1965 through about 1990 seemed to vindicate that premise. But then something changed, and without the social fabric obviously reknitting—without the revival of civic or religious life or the strengthening of community attachments and family bonds that people on both sides of the culture war earnestly desired— crime rates fell, and teenage delinquency diminished, and the pattern of everyday life became more stable and law abiding and simply safe."

#### "virtual reality manages the political passions, not by fomenting real revolution but by encouraging people to playact extremism, to reenact the 1930s or 1968 on social media or a Reddit thread or a YouTube video channel, to approach radical politics the way they approach a first-person shooter game—as a kind of sport, a kick to the body chemistry, that doesn't actually put anything in their relatively comfortable late-modern lives at risk. A good Facebook brawl or Twitter mobbing might be the political equivalent of Huxley's Violent Passion Surrogate, delivering all the tonic effects of joining the Weathermen or the Black Panthers or Benito Mussolini's March on Rome with none of the physical inconveniences. The Internet might be bringing back the dramas and tragedies of history, only as a stage production, a costumed farce. Not completely, of course. Trump is really president, and if he accidentally stumbles into a global war or mismanages a pandemic, there will be nothing virtual about it and nothing decadent about the aftermath. But so far, where is Trump's abnormality, his incipient authoritarianism, most manifest? Where else but on his Twitter feed. As the actual, real-life president, he is weak, not strong, hemmed in, not unbound, overwhelmed by the job rather than bending its powers to his will. In the real world, the world of legislation and policy making, Trump-era politics are the same politics of gridlock and stalemate as before, with lots of lying and more corruption and occasional forays into cruelty from the man at the top but nothing resembling the ascent of real authoritarians in the real 1930s. There is a virtual Trump presidency whose depredations terrify liberals, and then also a virtual presidency that airs on Fox and on his phone in which he goes from strength to strength. But three years in, the real thing is still closer to the genre the president knows best—reality television—than to the return of pre-1989 history. Close Twitter, log off Facebook, turn off cable television, and what do you see in the Trump-era United States? Campuses in tumult? No: the small wave of campus protests, most of them focused around parochial controversies, crested before his election and has diminished since. Urban riots? No: the post-Ferguson are of urban protest has died down. A wave of political violence? Sort of, but one that's more analogous to school shootings than to the political clashes of the 1930s or the 1960s, in the sense that it involves disturbed people appointing themselves as knights-errant and going forth to slaughter, rather than organized movements with any kind of strategy or concrete goal."

The left-wing dude who tries to assassinate Republicans isn't just a little deeper into the Resistance mind-set than the average activist; he's the guy who totally misunderstands the Resistance, who listens to all the online talk about treason and fascism and thinks that he's really in 1940s France and his online allies are actually the Maquis instead of just the suburban-liberal cosplay version. The guy who shows up at the Comet pizza parlor in Northwest DC with a gun because he thinks that prominent liberals are running a pedophile dungeon downstairs, or the guy who parks his truck on the Hoover Dam and demands that certain imaginary indictments be unsealed isn't just a little bolder and action oriented than the typical "Pizzagate" or "QAnon" conspiracy theorists; he fundamentally misunderstands the meaning and purpose of those labyrinthine theories, taking them as literal claims about the world rather than as what they are for their creators (a sport, a grift, a hobby) and for most of their participants (political entertainment and an odd form of virtual community)."

The reason that Steve Bannon achieved— for a brief spell—so much celebrity was that almost alone among Trumpian figures, he seemed to have a coherent philosophy beyond grifting, and I emphasize that "seemed" because there's a possibility that all his name-checks of fascist intellectuals were part of the grift as well. The reason that the Antifa kids favor masks is that an awful lot of them are playacting their revolution, and they don't want to put their names and faces to something that's fundamentally just a game. Or take the most extreme and briefly terrifying example: the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that promised to "Unite the Right," and brought white supremacists of the old-school skinhead and new-model "preppy dudes with tiki torches" varieties together for a weekend of marching, networking, and phony brawls with Antifa. When one of their numbers took the Weimar playacting literally and drove his car through a crowd of counterprotestors, killing a woman outright, did it invigorate the nascent movement, inspiring organized violence, and bring in new recruits eager for a chance at real mayhem? Not really: the movement rapidly disunited, dissolving into finger-pointing and disavowals, and by the time the one-year anniversary of Charlottesville rolled around, the attempt to host a similar rally in Washington, DC, produced the indelible image of a few pathetic-looking white nationalist leaders huddled together in their special DC Metro car—generals abandoned by their foot soldiers at the first whiff of real violence, outnumbered by the gawking journalists."

Instead, the bureaucracy offers counseling and pharmaceutical treatment for the depression that turns out to be commonplace in a social environment supposedly devoted to carefree hedonism, free contraception to prevent the harm of STDs and the still-graver danger of pregnancy [...], mildly repressive rules for campus speech that gently discourage anything that might upset students educated into left-liberal assumptions about the universe and their own identities, and the strange emergent phenomenon that the law professors Jeannie Suk and Jacob Gersen have dubbed the "sex bureaucracy"—a system intended to prevent rape and sexual assault that turns campus administrators into "bureaucrats of desire, responsible for defining healthy, permissible sex and disciplining deviations from those supposed norms.""

#### "The absence of due process in the sex bureaucracy sometimes perpetrates injustices against young men, which in turn produces some anxiety and backlash from parents and donors, but the constituency likely to rally in defense of a privileged dude accused of rape when he actually just acted like a creep is inherently limited, and most kids experience the sex bureaucracy as a soft despotism rather than an active one. The conformism imposed by politically correct rules of discourse provokes a certain kind of backlash from right-leaning students and alums—but that backlash usually is itself so extreme (inviting Milo Yiannopoulos to freak out the squares!) that it only confirms the campus consensus that right-wing speech can be reasonably excluded without any intellectual cost. Meanwhile, the more prevalent form of protest, from the social-justice left, exists in symbiosis with the pink-police-state apparatus: protestors take offense at some campus-specific controversy or at the residua of vanished white male patriarchy (a statue, a title, a song), and the administration responds by promising to establish yet another layer of caring bureaucracy devoted to identitarian forms of personal empowerment—one in which, upon graduation, a certain type of protestor can immediately find work. Nothing quite like this system exists in the world that awaits outside of college. But a similar health-and-safety culture dominates the neighborhoods and workplaces into which many college graduates matriculate, and especially the planned campuses in which the most technically proficient among them work."

#### "what the Internet really offers is the illusion of privacy, the feeling of communicating unobserved—and because of that feeling, most Internet users don't feel the need to shroud themselves in pseudonyms, preferring to communicate online the way they do at parties or in living rooms, texting and e-mailing and DM-ing in the same casual style that one would once have used in a letter or a phone call, and engaging in social media as though their tweets and posts are only going to be read by intimates and pals instead of the world entire. Which means, inevitably, that they are actually much more exposed—to strangers and enemies, ex-lovers and ex-friends, hackers and stalkers—than human beings ever would have been before their social lives migrated online. And they are exposed, above all, to a novel kind of persecution and harassment, because the ability to see so many half-formed, poorly thought-out ideas and opinions issuing all over has tempted people to do what people do best: to go after their enemies or perceived enemies, to dox them and drag them and ideally get them red, to invent new crimes to describe tweets or Facebook posts that they find offensive, and to generally act, without being hired or paid to do it by any central authority, like cops."

Instead of official requirements to participate and conform, there will be soft pressure, constant nudges—health insurance premiums tied to your fitness-monitoring watch, car insurance premiums tied to the "smartness" of your car, a raft of appliances that monitor you automatically unless you explicitly opt out, and the general knowledge that your every move could be caught on a surveillance camera or simply on someone's smartphone and then shared as widely as social media can reach. Instead of an explicit program of political repression, there will be haphazard mob-based enforcement of social and political norms and occasional Big Data-enabled abuses that keep everyone on his or her toes.

#### "It's just the evolution of elite strategies of control, elite responses to the potential downsides of a hyperindividualist, hedonistic culture. Mass incarceration as practiced by politicians of both parties was the first stage of that evolution, a desperate and flailing and often-brutal attempt to use state power to deal with the anarchic consequences of the 1960s, the sexual revolution and the drug culture and the decline of moralistic institutions. To be maximally cynical, it was a way for affluent suburbanites to protect their right to get divorced and sleep in on Sunday morning and smoke a little weed, by making sure that the increasingly fatherless sons of the demoralized underclass were locked up for dealing crack. Who needs churches and two-parent families and the old American puritanism, in other words, when you can have a culture that preaches "If it feels good, do it," and then puts the people who take that message too literally in prison? Extending that cynicism to the present era, you might say that mass incarceration became less necessary once virtual entertainments were invented to keep kids from broken homes indoors and take the edge off their physical and sexual aggression—and also once a surveillance state developed that made crime less likely to pay, escape from law enforcement more difficult, the outlaw life much harder to sustain. A similar point can be made about sex and pregnancy and childbearing as well. Just as we used mass incarceration as a strategy for managing crime, beginning in the 1970s we used abortion to manage teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births, substituting the vacuum pump for shotgun marriages and sexual restraint. Tellingly, both incarceration and abortion are hidden forms of violence, one imposed through a distant archipelago of prisons and the other in the darkness of the womb, both creating an illusion of peace sustained by a denial of the reality of what happened in a cellblock, what the abortionist dealt out. But, also tellingly, both have become less necessary to the system over time: as the pink police state has come of age, abortion rates have fallen alongside both crime and incarceration rates—both because virtual sex no less than virtual violence takes the edge off real-world desire, and also because the system relies increasingly on chemical solutions that are kinder than abortion, such as the temporary sterilization of Depo-Provera, to make sure that the poor don't have too many kids. And then it also relies on pharmaceutical abortions, so that the violence that remains is even more secret and private than before. You might also extend this argument to foreign policy, and to the way our system deals with the threat of terrorism, Islamic and otherwise. The wars that immediately followed 9/11, the invade-and-occupy-and-nation-build strategy that came to grief in Iraq and Afghanistan, were an analogue to the mass-incarceration era's blunt-force approach to the dangers unleashed by late-modern discontents. The turn toward drone warfare and surgical assassinations from the Obama era onward, meanwhile, is a lower-cost and less-violent approach, and therefore perhaps a more sustainable one—using technological breakthroughs, virtual warfare (for the soldiers at our end, not the targets at the other), and the awesome power of surveillance to hunt down enough terrorists that even if their deaths encourage new recruits, their organizations are too harried to ever bring their war back to our shores. The watchword in all these cases is sustainability. A system of control that requires huge prisons and 1.5 million abortions annually will inspire outrage, activism, and protest. But a system of control that relies on constant surveillance, technologically abetted house arrest, virtual entertainments and pharmaceutical sterilization and prescription abortions will fade more into the background of everyday life."

#### "the Panopticon is also adaptable, drawing even the rebels back into its matrix of playacting and performance, or perhaps encouraging and elevating forms of rebellion that are well suited for that matrix, that emerge from within its rules, its simulated realities, and can be reabsorbed. [...] much of the right-wing revolt against the system has a similar attention-seeking quality: conservative populists talk about overthrowing what they see as a left-wing system of surveillance and cultural control, but their specific demands often circle back to a desire for their own place within the system—a space to monetize their YouTube videos and to circulate their pro-Trump memes, free from fears of shadow banning and deplatforming and banishment to obscure apps or social spaces. In other words, Trump-era populism draws a certain kind of energy from moving back and forth across the safety/danger line, but when pressed, it prefers to appeal to the system as a client demanding services, or as a subject demanding its rights, rather than accepting the options for exile—understandably enough, since most of the extrapanoptical options are crawling with white supremacists, and the provocateurs who actually get banished from the social media monopolies soon find themselves unable to monetize their provocations."

#### "the populists are fighting primarily for the right to entertain and monetize, and their performance of political incorrectness and loud complaints when that performance inspires brushback is less a real rebellion than a validation of the larger system, the outskirts of which they are content to occupy so long as there is money to be made. In this, the media populists are playing the same game as Trump himself, who remains part of the Fake News Complex that he's supposedly at war with—desperate for the attention of the Washington Post or CNN even as he attacks them, whining about his Twitter numbers to anyone who listens, well aware that he's driving ratings and subscriptions higher among his supposed "enemies" and willing to take the deal because he wants to be in their headlines, whatever the cost. Which is why you could make the case that a true radicalism, a true threat to the Panopticon, would not be visible online at all; the rebellions that we can see percolating are, almost by definition, codependent with the system, constrained and pushed constantly toward entertainment by their choice to depend upon and negotiate with an order they supposedly abhor."

And the mix of anxieties and aspirations involved seem querulous, irascible, nostalgic—a populism of the Western twilight, a nationalism of civilizational old age, a reaction to stagnation that's stagnationist itself."

Even the nationalists of eastern Europe, the most politically effective Western populists, don't actually want to leave the European Union. They mostly seem to want to roll back the clock to the degree of national independence enjoyed by member states circa 1975, with less immigration and more domestic cronyism than EU norms allow. The promise to "make X great again" thus cashes out as a more ethnocentric way to experience sclerosis, a little more self-determination amid stagnation, plus a dose of corruption on the side."

#### "It is not always easy, but human beings can still live vigorously amid a general stagnation, be fruitful amid sterility, be creative amid repetition, and build good and fully human lives that offer, in microcosm, a counterpoint and challenge to the decadent macrocosm. And the decadent society, unlike the full dystopia, allows those signs of contradictions to exist, which means that, under decadence, it always remains possible to imagine and work toward renewal and renaissance. This is not always the case, to put it mildly, when you gamble on a revolution, or hasten a crisis, or open the doors to barbarians from outside or within. Of course, one of the recurring critiques of the decadent society is that its stability is an illusion, that sustainable decadence is a contradiction in terms, and that decadence always makes a civilization uniquely vulnerable to crisis, invasion, destruction—in which case it's better to gamble on the revolution, risks and all, than just sit waiting for the inevitable coup de grace."

#### "Technological stagnation means that robots won't kill us all or even take our jobs; intellectual and religious and ideological stagnation means fewer fanaticisms and utopian follies; demographic decline is defusing the population bomb; and economic stagnation could be the only force capable of limiting carbon emissions and keeping climate change manageable. The crucial task for twenty-first-century humanity, in this view, would be making the most of a prosperous stagnation: learning to temper our expectations and live within limits; making sure existing resources are distributed more justly; improving institutional functioning at the margins; using education to lift people, especially young men, out of the prison-and-virtual-reality nexus and into the sunlit uplands of the creative class; treating the chronic conditions of old age more humanely; and doing everything we can to help poorer countries transition successfully into our current position. This would require accepting that the postwar boom isn't coming back, accepting that the space race was mostly just Cold War posturing, accepting that we're an aging society that can't afford vast socialist experiments or growth-chasing supply-side fantasies, accepting that we aren't going to spread democracy by force of arms—accepting, in other words, that the discontents motivating idealists of the center and populists of the right and left are just differing forms of nostalgia, which can be managed but never satisfied, and which are ultimately just impediments to achieving contentment in our civilization's old age."

But his real temperament was technocratic and managerial, and the management of decadence—a "Don't do stupid shit" approach to everything from financial capitalism and globalization, to China and the Middle East—was an essential feature of Obaman governance. Which his enemies and critics recognized. Conservatives called it "managing decline," the left called it "neoliberalism," and the Trump-Sanders populist efflorescence emerged from those critiques."

And for all its faults, our technocratic elite—the Romney-Republican variation as well as the Obamanauts—has strong incentives to make sure that our in many ways enviable situation lasts as long as possible and can be enjoyed by as many people as possible while it does. Accepting rule by technocrats doesn't mean that we shouldn't also want reforms to help the people who aren't enjoying decadence, who are suffering economically or physically or emotionally—we should! But those reforms should take the (centrist, neoliberal, technocratic) form of better schools or better opioid treatment programs or better incentives for corporate investment in the heartland; they should be incremental, meliorist, and cautious. Not because meliorism can cure every ill, but because the more revolutionary alternatives are too dangerous, and a simple greatest-good-for-the-greatest number calculus requires that we keep the existing system running and seek its stability against fantasies of utopia or risky schemes for limitless expansion."

It's that any civilizational order, decadent or otherwise, is sustainable only until the right black-swan development arrives, at which point it might be doomed in a way that no simple extrapolation, no sociological analysis, could have possibly predicted. [...] Just as our Aztec futurist would have failed to see European microbes coming, an analyst of Roman politics in the age of the Antonines couldn't have predicted the impact of devastating plagues on the later empire, and a pundit in thirteenth-century Paris wouldn't have seen the worst of the Black Death coming and with it the collapse of the high-medieval order. So any discussion of how our decadence might end has to begin with an acknowledgment that the assassin might be something entirely invisible for now, some trend only now gathering unseen, some mutation that hasn't happened yet, some catastrophe that in hindsight will seem essentially random, noncontingent and unrelated to any specific feature of our age."

#### "what was, in hindsight, unwarranted anxiety during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when "as goes Greece, so goes the entire West" was a common fear among deficit hawks, and everyone from German bankers to Tea Party Republicans was preaching the absolute necessity of austerity. This style of thinking had a lot of intuitive power but foundered on the facts—specifically the total absence of the inflation that it predicted would follow from stimulus spending and quantitative easing. So today, including on the Trumpified American right, the consensus has turned over." ([Douthat 2020:172](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=172))

#### "the fear that we're printing and spending our way to disaster is conned to a dwindling band of deficit hawks and goldbugs and professional prophets of catastrophe—the sort of people who have successfully predicted thirteen of the last three recessions. [...] If some deep structural force such as population aging is keeping inflation in check even when unemployment falls, there's no reason why our technocrats can't manipulate the money supply to avoid another recession [...]. If interest rates are destined to stay low everywhere, there's no reason why the United States can't more or less eternally monetize its debt—with our Treasury bonds functioning, as the University of California economist Brad DeLong suggested, as a kind of modern version of the old Medici Bank: a safe and stable place to park your money even if you aren't getting some immense return. If long-assumed constraints on deficits and the money supply don't apply to an aging, stagnant economy, then our stagnation can be subsidized indefinitely."

#### "If the aftermath of the last Great Recession gave us Trump and Brexit, the new socialism and the new far right, it's certainly possible that another crack-up would take the ridiculous elements of today's populism and make them terrible instead. So imagine, as one scenario, a near-future debacle that starts with the current Chinese economic slowdown continuing and worsening, until China begins to look as stagnant as certain parts of Europe. This stall-out then interacts with China's rapidly worsening demographic balance and the repression and discontent in places such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong, creating a mix of economic and fiscal pressure that destabilizes the regime in Beijing (while also perhaps making it more bellicose). Then imagine that China's economic downturn also cuts off a lot of the foreign investment that has kept a place like Silicon Valley frothing with the capital that sustains money-losing enterprises— at which point it turns out that Chinese money was effectively sustaining another tech bubble, which bursts, taking Uber and a host of operations with it. Given tech's importance to the modern economy, that knocks the United States into a disastrous recession, in which overleveraged businesses collapse and state budgets fall apart. And the response from Washington is basically nonexistent, because the Congress is even more polarized and gridlocked than it was in 2007- 2009, and none of the various bailouts and stimulus packages that passed then can get through the legislature this time. So instead of the awed but somewhat effective response that mitigated the Great Recession, you get something more like the ailing and folly that followed the Crash of 1929. Likewise, when the contagion spreads to Europe, the Continent is more divided than in 2009-2010, the pro-European Union consensus weaker, and instead of Berlin and Brussels forcing the periphery to accept their economic terms, you get failed governments everywhere, Grexit and Italexit and then even a French departure. This, in turn, deepens the economic downturn, with trade barriers going up as economies contract, which feeds political turbulence in North Africa and the Middle East, which generates another refugee crisis, which further empowers the far right even as the economic crisis further empowers the far left. Then all of these developments, in Europe and the United States, interact with the Internet and its extremist element in a way that proves that when youth unemployment climbs high enough, YouTube and Twitter can be genuinely radicalizing even in an aging society, and cities and campuses can fill up permanently with protestors even when there's endless entertainment on their screens. Bombing campaigns proliferate, riots spread, the American left finds its Hugo Chavez while the American right finds a more effective version of Trump. Fascists and Marxists compete for power in Europe, China goes to war with its neighbors to escape domestic turmoil. Put it all together and suddenly we're no longer experiencing a virtual 1930s, an online or reality-television simulacrum of the past, but the return of history, and the expiration of decadence in war and authoritarianism and human misery."

Overall, by 2100, two out of every five human beings could be African [...]. something will happen as Africa adds billions of people and the population of Europe, rich and aging, shrinks by a hundred million or more. In the late 1990s, Europe and Africa had about the same population; a hundred years later, there could be seven Africans for every European.

On the other side, a vision of a civilization with no common memory, no religious roots, no distinctives beyond its political procedures, and no self-awareness about its establishment's vaulting arrogance and historical illiteracy.

#### "my own account of the decadent society suggests that decadence is perpetually seductive even to its critics. In which case, any alternative would need to begin with institutions that have more power and more scale; it would need to be a nationalist renewal, not just a local one, because only the nation-state has the scale and potency to experiment with different political forms without being dissolved or crushed. This is the political right's clearest answer to decadence at the moment, embodied not only in the various attempts to provide intellectual scaffolding for Trumpism, but also in documents such as the Paris Statement of 2016, in which a group of the Continent's right-leaning thinkers united to argue that the "true Europe is a community of nations," not the officially cosmopolitan EU, and that only through the kind of national community that both "competes with other nations" and "takes pride in governing itself in its own way" can European culture be renewed. In this theory, nationalism resupplies many of the things that are dissolving under decadence: the historical and religious memory required for real artistic greatness, the communal support required for marriage and family and ordinary human flourishing, the sense of competition and common purpose required to spur technological progress, and the common bonds that enable good government to triumph over factionalism and gridlock."

The leading theoretician of nationalist renewal is an Israeli intellectual, Yoram Hazony, who in his recent book The Virtue of Nationalism makes an audacious attempt to construct a kind of Jewish-Protestant-Anglo-American tradition of nationalism that he claims has been buried by the lapsed-Catholic imperialism of the current European project. (The German aggressors who destroyed Europe in the twentieth century, in Hazony's account, are imperialist rather than nationalist figures, thus quarantining the Hitlerian nightmare—supposedly— from his nationalist project.)"

Likewise, in American Judaism today, the extraordinary birthrate differential between the Orthodox and their Reform and Conservative cousins is ensuring that Judaism's future will be more devout than would have been expected two generations ago."

#### "Already there is a strong post-Christian religious tendency that's visible in various places in our culture but hasn't taken on a fully coherent, culture-shaping form. It might usefully be described as an inchoate neo-paganism— meaning not the literal worship of Osiris or Odin (or not necessarily), but a general belief in the immanent divine, in a supernatural reality that's interwoven with the material world rather than standing outside it as a Creator God. [...] There is the highbrow tradition of intellectual and aesthetic pantheism [...], which shows up among a lot of contemporary writers who are spiritual but not religious, gnostic but not Christian, pantheistic but not theistic." ([Douthat 2020:201](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=201))

#### "Next, there is the more middlebrow embrace of New Age spirituality and self-help religion, which emphasizes the pursuit of spiritual experience as a means to health, wealth, and happiness in this life: the Oprah Winfrey, Eat Pray Love, Deepak Chopra style of late-modern religion, which draws from a mélange of religious sources, Western and Eastern, but mostly emphasizes a therapeutic form of faith [...]. (The Jungian masculinism of Jordan Peterson may be playing a similar role for his devotees.)" ([Douthat 2020:201](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=201))

#### "Then there is the most overt and literal form of neo-paganism: the booming business in horoscopes and astrology, the psychics and mediums [...], and the people (overrepresented on the online extremes of left and right, interestingly) who simply self-describe as Wiccan or neo-pagan, and whose numbers are growing fast enough [...]. the Hindu and Shinto and Buddhist and animist traditions that still predominate in the Indian subcontinent and East Asia, all of which have some increasing influence in North America and Europe." ([Douthat 2020:202](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=202))

#### "nowadays our intellectuals seem embarrassed by anything too frankly supernaturalist, and our Silicon Valley overlords prefer to launder their religious impulses through techno-utopianism rather than New Age rituals. Moreover, the last extended elite flirtation with neo-paganism reached a horrific apotheosis in Nazi Germany, and today's elite is justifiably frightened of releasing those dark forces—meaning that they might cling to the egalitarian aspect of Christianity even if it's part of a strained and incoherent world picture, rather than risking the aristocratic, decidedly inegalitarian temptations that can creep in when you make the natural world your moral standard." ([Douthat 2020:202](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=202))

#### "Still, the range of different forms of paganism means that the raw materials are there for something more dramatic—if the philosophers of pantheism became a little less secularized and a little more mystical, and the New Agers and neo-pagans became a little more organized and centralized, and the convergence interacted with political and civic changes to create a new kind of widespread public worship, complete perhaps with the construction of new sacred spaces, new temples, in the heart of the world's cities."

#### "One could imagine—hypothetically!—an Islam that induced post-Christian intellectuals to turn from their incoherent agnosticism to a non-Western form of Unitarianism, an Islam that offered the decaying Western working class an abstemious and purpose-driven and family-centered social order, an Islam that attracted some of the lost boys drawn to far right politics (a few far right European figures have actually made that leap; "a moderated form of Islam is probably the West's only hope," the famous MAGA personality Mike Cernovich tweeted recently), an Islam that somehow adapted the faith's puritanical tradition to the puritanical late feminism of #MeToo. [...] The story of Christian history is one of unexpected resurrections, of what G. K. Chesterton called the "five deaths of the faith" (the fall of Rome, the Muslim challenge, the crisis of the Reformation, the Enlightenment, the march of Darwinism) giving way to unlooked-for renewals and rebirths."

#### "In the event that there were a renewal of interest in Christianity within the developed world's elite, or a grassroots Great Awakening that fills the yawning social void where populism currently flourishes, it would still find a vast preexisting Christian infrastructure, which it might reclaim and fill with newfound zeal, like empty wineskins with new wine. But perhaps, to go back to Robert Sarah's Vendée speech, the next resurrection of Christianity is already happening outside the West, and the fate of Christianity in Europe and North America will be shaped by forces external to the Christian faith's old heartlands. If it's possible to imagine a late-twenty- first-century world remade by African numbers and Chinese power, it's also possible to imagine a religious landscape remade by African and Chinese Christianities. The former is a peripheral force for non-Africans for now, but a dynamic, continent-reshaping force south of the Sahara; the latter is a persecuted minority faith but one that's arguably the strongest non-Communist worldview in China, with the potential to take over the Middle Kingdom much as Christianity once took over the Roman Empire: slowly, and then all at once. Imagine a Eurafrica in which black Christians fill the Gothic churches of the Old Continent—something that happens already if you look in the right Parisian neighborhood—and then gain enough power and influence to build new ones, in new-old styles, in both Nantes and Nairobi. Imagine a Chinese empire circa 2100 that's more Christian than its secularized or paganized American rival for global power, and that's governed by a Confucian-influenced version of the old throne-and-altar integralism that liberalism overthrew. Imagine a global renaissance of Christian art and architecture, philosophy and literature, in which American and European Christians are, at best, bit players. Or imagine a reversal of the scenario I conjured earlier, in which some Chinese breakthrough in genetic engineering leads to a global Eugenics War; imagine instead that it's a suddenly Christianizing China and its African allies resisting the secular West's genetic engineering, its attempted Homo Deus leap."

#### "Indeed, just about any scenario for a religious revival could be linked to backlash against some dehumanizing technological development. [...] you wouldn't necessarily need the huge AI or biotech leap: even a refinement of existing virtual reality, one that draws more people more fully into the violence and pornography of unreal playgrounds, would seem to demand a religious response, even a dramatic one. Perhaps not quite a jihad... but at the very least an effort to tame and humanize the new technologies of simulation that escapes current culture war categories sufficiently to usher in a different—at long last— religious era than the one the baby boomers made." ([Douthat 2020:206](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=206))

#### "isn't just that some technological advance could, as suggested above, act in creative tension with religion by provoking a moral crusade or jihad in response. It's also that scientific and religious experiments proceed from a similar desire for knowing, a similar belief that the universe is patterned and intelligible and that its secrets might somehow be unlocked. Which is why in periods of real intellectual ferment and development, there is often a general surge of experimentation that extends across multiple ways of seeking knowledge, from the scientific and experimental, to the theological and mystical, to the gray zones and disputed territories in between. Thus, the assumption, common to rationalists today, that religion represents a form of unreason that science has to vanquish on its way to new ages of discovery, is as mistaken as the religious reflex that regards the scientific mind-set as an inevitable threat to the pious simplicities of faith. In fact, early modern scientists were fascinated by scriptural prophecies, the Victorians read Darwin while organizing seances, and the space age was awash in strange religious ferments. The rocket science of the 1940s had an occultist, hermetic side, embodied in figures such as Jack Parsons, the founder of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a disciple of Aleister Crowley, who recited Crowley's "Hymn to Pan" during rocket tests and conducted rituals with L. Ron Hubbard aimed at bringing the female divinity "Babalon" to earth. The moon landing itself, of course, coincided with the dawning of the Age of Aquarius on earth. And the larger Apollo project, as Kendrick Oliver argues in his history of the space program, To Touch the Face of God: The Sacred, the Profane, and the American Space Program, 1957-75, was intertwined in the aspirations and anxieties of the postwar American Protestant revival—culminating in the famous Christmas Eve reading of Genesis 1 by astronaut Bill Anders as Apollo 8 orbited the earth and men wept in mission control below. In his conclusion, Oliver makes the case that a sense of religious mission was crucial to the national commitment to space travel, and the fading of the missionary spirit, as much as any technological impediment, contributed to the closing of the final frontier" ([Douthat 2020:207f](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/946RNI9D?page=207))

#### "I suspect that a truly globalized civilization cannot help tending toward decadence so long as it remains earthbound, so long as there is no hope of finding actual new worlds to leap toward, conquer, or explore. I suspect that what we see happening in our society today—the turn toward simulations and virtual realities; the declining birthrates; the sense of repetition, stagnation, and futility—is connected on a deep level to the post-Apollo mission sense that such a hope does not exist, that there is quite literally nowhere else for mankind to go, that we are stuck here waiting to either destroy ourselves accidentally or to have nature hit reboot, via comet or a plague, on our entire up-from-hunter-gathering, east-of-Eden project."
