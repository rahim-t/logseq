### the knowledge reference products in the market today fall short of mapping, in a highly organized way, everything we collectively know as a human society and what exists on the web.
:PROPERTIES:

### It is now possible and necessary to map everything that exists systematically and pull together academic papers, documentaries, videos, podcasts, further reading, guides and meta-data that surrounds these topics.

### pages like [SV Angel](https://golden.com/wiki/SV_Angel), [Benchling](https://golden.com/wiki/Benchling), [Lisk](https://golden.com/wiki/Lisk), [Urbit](https://golden.com/wiki/Urbit) and many others are and have been deleted from Wikipedia because they don't reach the notability standard of the website.

:END:

### [Product Hunt](https://golden.com/wiki/Product_Hunt) was recently up for deletion but somehow survived the cull. Additionally, [HelloSign](https://golden.com/wiki/HelloSign), a few weeks before Dropbox acquired it for $230 million was [removed from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/HelloSign). [BuildZoom](https://golden.com/wiki/BuildZoom) was removed 5 times from Wikipedia and now doesn't exist there. It doesn't just apply to company pages though. Actual technologies, projects, products, theoretical electrical components and academic ideas are missing as well.

### There are currently [5.8 million English language articles in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics), and Google had [1 billion objects (200x Wikipedia's size) in its Knowledge Graph](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html) when it launched in 2015. We estimate internally that there are 1000x the entities to cover than what Wikipedia has today. It’s an exciting challenge!

### we eventually want to map everything that exists.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:9950fa0c-3859-404e-b7ad-92de5f51a124
:END:

### Today, we have a great opportunity to use new technologies to solve the problems: [human in the loop AI systems](https://golden.com/suggestions), [fully automatic and unsupervised language writing systems](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models), [WYSIWYG editors](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate), React, cheap cloud storage/processing, auto [spelling/grammar checking](https://golden.com/wiki/Grammarly), graph databases, [real identity](https://www.wikitribune.com/project/real-names-policy-a-note-from-jimmy-wales/) and collaboration models like [Git](https://golden.com/wiki/Git) pave the way to build a new system for compiling and serving the knowledge.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:f46a76d4-22a0-45f7-ad6f-ba5e467d5a6c
:END:

### We have built speedy citation tools into Golden and intend to create more affordances around claim validation. You can simply highlight any claim and add a citation that is evidence to support that claim.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:b39226f5-b7f4-4cae-8837-c026ee0101c1
:END:

### We have gone a little step further by allowing ‘high resolution’ citations i.e. being able to highlight the specific part of the claim you want to back up. Over time, we want to have tighter bindings between claims and evidence in order to improve claim verification.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:29bc9886-c1ef-477d-84a2-27b7bf45e885
:END:

### we have built a system called “AI suggestions” which produces modular snippets of machine-learning outputs, suggested improvements that can be made to the content with simple “yes”, “no”, or “skip.”
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:d0eed184-33e4-4347-ba2f-94dfbc00e2e4
:END:

### The AI assistant will use URLs to extract relevant information to add to the topic page.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:b3c227f7-6597-4b30-8dc5-4a3ed5f83ba3
:END:

### When you paste a URL into one of our “magic cells” (i.e., a cell marked with the wand icon) in Golden, our tool will auto-extract key information from that URL, such as the title and authors of an article, abstracts, and more.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:2cce4610-48ba-4389-a60d-04898e3b85ec
:END:

### we are embracing Creative Commons 4.0 for the text on topic pages and are cognisant of current standards of openness. Public topic pages will be free to access and the text available on CC BY-SA 4.0.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:694d48ee-83e4-410c-88f5-1bc97cb745a5

### Paid users can use the Golden Query Tool to search across Golden’s knowledge base to find specific information in more corporate-focused queries.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:085b0f6c-d4bc-4809-abff-e5fd234f5730
:END:

### We do, from time to time, open up queries to the public that we think are useful for everyone, e.g., [Y Combinator Batch W19](https://golden.com/y-combinator-w19-companies), or [a list of therapeutics companies](https://golden.com/list-of-therapeutics-companies) or [all the VC firms](https://golden.com/list-of-venture-capital-firms/), [all crypto currency projects we could find whitepapers for](https://golden.com/cryptocurrency-whitepapers), [regenerative medicine companies](https://golden.com/list-of-regenerative-medicine-companies/), etc.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:826ece5a-ed6d-4fd9-a2b3-4853924ab638

### We believe this advanced query tool is extremely useful for investment funds, large consultancies and large companies
:PROPERTIES:

### We have high-quality researchers available to build out knowledge
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:d51f92b2-d839-4487-b1fc-f1e3b08d18bf
:END:

### Paid users who come across topic pages that don’t have as much desired information can simply click the “Request info” button. This kicks off a process with our research team and AI bots to quickly build better and more content.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:911cfce7-3a41-408e-b250-9f7cceb064bd

## [Golden - Mapping human knowledge with AI | Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/golden) #quote
### We have set out to: 1. Cover all topics that exist over time rather than just ‘notable’ topics. 2. Go into greater depth around a topic, from its timeline to videos and other useful resources surrounding the topic (eg learning videos, further reading, blog posts, Q&A, podcasts etc). 3. Support a larger population of people trying to learn about topics. 4. Make knowledge more accessible, richer and fun to read about. 5. Allow you to track topics of interest and be updated when new information is available on the subject. 6. Save time making the knowledge in the first place by using design, UI and AI to aid construction of the information. Especially by automating repetitive tasks and bring smart editor features.

### Not sure why would anyone come up with one more idea for one more way of organizing knowledge that isn't intuitive, or needed for that matter. Humans have already shown that all they need is a clean & simple search engine, not a busy cluster of things to navigate through. It actually reminds me the old AOL and Yahoo, which couldn't succeed for variety of reasons, and aren't used anymore.
#### Pros:
##### Organized knowledge

#### Cons:
##### Busy, gadgety, gimmicky, unclear, "unfree", unintuitive, unnecessary.

### Jude from Golden here. Agreed that Wikipedia is one of the best things that has been created so far by humans - I use it all the time. The biggest learning surprise so far was the scale of lack of information compiled out there. When I started digging deeper the cardinality of entities we want to map came out to be approx 10bn which is around 1000x the article count on WP. I just kept running up against pages like this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryobacterium) when it could be like this [https://golden.com/wiki/Cryobact...](https://golden.com/wiki/Cryobacterium) or this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginkgo_Bioworks) when it could be this [https://golden.com/wiki/Ginkgo_B...](https://golden.com/wiki/Ginkgo_Bioworks) Too many topics were being deleted or not being covered fast enough or in enough depth. In terms of non product learning, building a company the second time around was just as hard as the first time round. The first time around the naivety is actually useful in that you take high risk, the second time around you have a couple of scars that make you want to feel more risk adverse. Building products that people use daily is a very very hard thing to do. Another major learning part is, your team is everything, so hire the best (which doesn't mean most experienced necessarily but more so motivated by the mission and faster learners).

### Wikipedia is an amazing resource with deep defensibility. What's been the biggest learning or surprise so far, [@judegomila](https://www.producthunt.com/@judegomila)?
