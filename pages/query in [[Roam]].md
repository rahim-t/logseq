### I start by making a page. I call these pages Looking Lenses, but you could think of it as a multi-step saved search process.

### I pull up my [open question]s

### I find that understanding a problem and designing a solution comes with many [[question]]. When they’re project specific, I turn them into todos. This gives me a starting point rather than a blank page. I’ll spend some time writing responses to those [[question]], developing the [[question]] into new formulations, and adding any new [[question]] that I have.

### These are the sorts of [[question]] that can be turned into queries, which are basically a search into your database using the power of logical operators. I keep a list of tags of related ideas on some of the more general pages, like search behavior or onboarding.

### 1. Saved searches! Sometimes it’s more agile to simply look through the linked references for a page, but after, I’ll turn them into queries. This way, I know what I’ve already looked through and can pick up where I left off when I revisit this page.

### If a search works out to be unfruitful, then I’ll delete the query and explicitly write down: “Asking my database for _ was unhelpful for the purposes of this project.”

### 2. Queries also allow me to ask more meaningful [[question]] than linked reference filters do.

### As I’m processing my queries, I’m keeping track of the specific blocks that seem most relevant to the goal of this research project and block referencing them into an outline in the sidebar. If I recognize a common theme between blocks, I group them together under a heading. I’ll also add a layer of commentary next to block references, providing myself context for why it was included in the outline if it’s not self-evident.

### These outlines give me a deeper understanding of how previous pieces of thought map together and where the gaps are. If I need new information, I document my searches on the web on these looking lens pages as well.

### It’s my personal preference to have the outline on the saved search process page, and control-shift-o to open that block in the sidebar. Fun trick – you can rearrange your outline easily through drag-and-drop by opening the outline in the sidebar next to the outline.

### Following a process like this, you end up with something that models a conversation. Your queries represent questions to your past self. Block references are the best answers. Your comments are the responses.
