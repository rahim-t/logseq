#### "Just as Ender's Game predicted video games' growing importance in war way back in 1985, Daniel Suarez's Daemon novels described a future in which an artificial intelligence runs the economy by controlling humans like video game characters." ([McCormick 2020:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=2))

#### __"When video game developer Matthew Sobol dies, he unleashes a computer program, the Daemon, on the world. It infiltrates the computer systems of major corporations and governments, crippling them, while simultaneously coordinating the actions of Daemon-sympathetic humans on the Darknet, an Augmented Reality layer that turns the physical world into a video game. By incentivizing humans with points, status, and credits, the Daemon turns civilization into a video game and rebuilds a new economy from the ground up.__

#### Today, three trends are converging to make a version of Suarez's predictions possible: 1. Video Games are Eating the World. Video games are worth more than the film industry already, and games are spawning thriving virtual economies. 2. Business-in-a-Box (BiaB). Software is replacing more pieces of every industry's value chain, and making it easier to operate businesses at higher levels of abstraction. 3. Everyone is an Investor. As more assets become more investible by more people, we move up another level of abstraction, to the point where more of our work is a capital allocation game." ([McCormick 2020:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=2))

#### "instead of AI controlling humans like video game characters, humans will run Business-as-a-Game (BaaG). That means: Game-like Environment with Real-World Implications. One digital interface through which an operator or operators can run a business and lead people, like a MMOG. High Level of Abstraction. The business should operate at a high enough level of abstraction that goals are understood and important metrics are trackable and actionable, like numeric attributes, health scores, and points in games. Persistent Environment, Liquid Resources. Because of clarity around goals and metrics, players should be able to join and leave companies on-demand, like Uber drivers with specialized skills, aiding in the quest when most useful. Rewards Based on Skills and Contributions. People should be able to join companies semi-anonymously, via an avatar tied to a confirmed real identity that is not necessarily visible to the employee (Crucible is making this possible). People will be hired and rewarded based on trackable contributions instead of traditional credentials. At the simplest level, BaaG is just a shiny new interface on top of existing tools that makes work feel more fun. One way to think of it is, "What if developers built business-in-a-box software in the Unreal Engine?"" ([McCormick 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=3))

#### "Business-as-a-Game is only possible in a world of relative abundance, where basic needs are met and we can afford to spend more time on creative and financial pursuits. Already, more business runs through software than ever before, and already, virtual economies are real and massive. According to SuperData, virtual marketplaces generated $109 billion in 2019, 85% of which came from the purchase of virtual goods." ([McCormick 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=3))

#### "the most prized skill will be capital allocation." ([McCormick 2020:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=3))

#### "Fortnite has been an absolute monster, with over 350 million players and $1.8 billion in 2019 revenue." ([McCormick 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=4))

#### "In the game, Epic brings together brands and media companies like the NFL, Jordan Brand, DC Comics, Marvel, and more in one digital marketplace. It's also shown that a game environment can host activities that go beyond playing a game, from premiering the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker trailer in the game to hosting the Travis Scott: Astronomical concert attended by over 12 million people simultaneously." ([McCormick 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=4))

#### "Most of the $109 billion in virtual marketplace revenue goes not to the platforms or game developers, but to individuals and small companies that create digital items for purchase in-game. In games like Roblox and Manticore, users create and monetize not just in-game items, but their own games and their own worlds. In 2020, Roblox expects that its creators will generate over $250 million, and Epic just led a $15 million round for Manticore, a Roblox for grownups." ([McCormick 2020:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=4))

#### "Even massive multinational businesses far too complex to run entirely out-of-the-box are now designing products as involved as cars and buildings within the Unity and Unreal engines, avoiding the time, expense, and imprecision of many rounds of physical prototypes." ([McCormick 2020:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=8))

#### "Because I use a suite of tools, from Substack to Roam to Figma to Twitter to LinkedIn, I know that I'm not in a game. In media, for a new writer or content creator more broadly to think that they're in a game would mainly just require a new UI on top of all of those tools." ([McCormick 2020:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=9))

#### "I could find and order product wholesale on Alibaba, set up a store on Shopify, drive customers to the site by buying ads on Facebook, Google, and Instagram, either myself or by hiring a growth marketing contractor on Marketerhire, take payments via Stripe, drop ship directly from China with Boxc or import with Flexport and ship with USPS, answer customer questions on Zendesk or Kustomer, and return items via Returnly." ([McCormick 2020:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=10))

#### "To get from where we are today to Ecommerce the Game would require: A rich virtual world in which players could design and render products (Unity or Unreal) Scoreboards that track CAC, LTV, attribution, costs, and other inputs, respond to user decisions and customer feedback in real-time, and present them simplified as points An interface that abstracts away administrative complexity - Stripe Atlas presented as "Name Your Business and Pick Your Global HQ" and Ramp presented as a way to spend points and earn rewards APIs to connect all of the tools that businesses currently use, from Shopify to Stripe to Facebook Ads Manager to USPS, and allow in-game actions to control real-world results" ([McCormick 2020:10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=10))

#### "As robots replace labor (each robot replaces 3.3 human jobs according to MIT), more business is run via software, and complexity is continually abstracted away, there are very few businesses that won't be able to be run as if they're games. I'm actually surprised that no one has developed game interfaces for running a business yet. When you start to think about all of the disparate, 2D tools we use to work as compared to the rich, contained environments in which gamers play, the way we do things seems bland." ([McCormick 2020:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=11))

#### "At its most abstracted, business is about resource allocation." ([McCormick 2020:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=11))

#### "We're essentially playing a video game every day as investing across various asset classes in real-time through digital interfaces becomes more mainstream. We have a certain number of points, and with increasing frictionlessness, we allocate those points to businesses or products that we think will put them to the best use." ([McCormick 2020:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=12))

#### "Today, a small business or startup can take out a loan near-instantaneously through Square Capital, Stripe Capital, Clearbanc, or Pipe, all of which read and lend against digitally legible cash flows in real-time. As regulations relax, software improves, and numbers become instantaneously available, more people are able to invest in more asset classes." ([McCormick 2020:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=12))

#### "Soon, Composer will let anyone build, test, and manage automated hedge-fund style portfolios through a simple UI." ([McCormick 2020:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=12))

#### "instead of holding down corporate jobs, we will behave more like players in video games, with our skills on offer to those who need us to complete their quests." ([McCormick 2020:13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=13))

#### "The beauty of games is that they lend importance to the objectively trivial. If we reach a level of abstraction in which we all become investors, sending money back and forth, wrapping it in a game will make it feel more meaningful." ([McCormick 2020:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=14))

#### "Companies like Tencent, Shopify, Snap, Stripe, Google, NVIDIA, Unity, Amazon, and many more will benefit tremendously as not just the way we shop, but the way we run businesses continues to evolve and move online." ([McCormick 2020:14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/53KAVVFF?page=14))
