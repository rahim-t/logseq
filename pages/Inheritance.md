## Inheritance: every user has to refer at least one user as trustee to inherit his [[Trust]] upon death
### Trustee can mark user as dead: one month waiting time giving user chance to ‘arise’

### If positive Honor then [[Trust]] and shares are transferred (minus credit) and user account deleted

### If credit larger than [[Trust]], [[Trust]]ee inherits debt

### Can be used for account reset if anonymity compromised (half of reputation lost)
