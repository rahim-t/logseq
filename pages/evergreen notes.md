## [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) #quote
### __Evergreen notes__ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes:

### Most people take only transient notes. That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight:

### “Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”. When done well, these notes can be quite valuable:

### Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work.

### It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:
#### Evergreen notes should be atomic

#### Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented

#### Evergreen notes should be densely linked

#### Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies

### This concept evolves in large part from Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten, which he regards as the independent intellectual partner in writing his 70 books. See

### Similarities and differences between evergreen note-writing and Zettelkasten

### Properties of Evergreen notes:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:7fed8a2d-637b-4a92-84f6-bfd22fcc789b
:END:
#### [Atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_atomic): Evergreen notes should be about one thing, and flesh out that one thing __well__.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:e7a4d42f-ab5f-490b-afef-8f2148990d24
:END:

#### Why atomic?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:3d213788-3297-4b4c-aea3-d7c2c783a9dc
:END:
##### When you make a note of something, it’s assumed to be important, which means it should be
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:761786b3-fb7b-4b75-bfd1-fdaab7831c23
:END:
###### easily findable (no broad notes), and
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:dfdd1100-3c6e-4a4d-a43b-c352cfe1a85c
:END:

###### easy to build on top of (no fragmented notes)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:6509e19a-91be-4d0f-9e7b-50583ac0c2e3
:END:

##### If a note is broad (i.e. contains more than one concept), it makes finding any concept contained in that note harder (since you have to sort through concepts).
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:1bea4b61-8101-4713-ac08-c9c62d85af7c
:END:

##### This is very similar in principle to the software engineering concept of loose coupling (low inter-dependency) and high cohesion (high intra-dependency). [More info about what that means here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14000762/what-does-low-in-coupling-and-high-in-cohesion-mean).
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:1c17d040-0ea2-4f61-82e5-b5bed86987af
:END:
###### [Well-titled](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs): Atomic notes act as building blocks, and a good title acts as a handle for grabbing the idea and moving it fluidly to wherever it needs to go.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:ec763eb1-a288-4409-95eb-3b779eab87db
:END:

##### With atomicity and a good title, you can treat Evergreen notes like [APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_note_titles_are_like_APIs): “on-demand” concepts.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:20817088-621c-42a2-87b5-bb8f602ecc68
:END:

#### [Concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_concept-oriented): Evergreen notes should be as concept oriented as possible for 3 reasons.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:903fb127-ec7c-429f-baaa-2436421c9bbc
:END:
##### 1) Concepts can manifest across different domains. When your notes are concepts, they’re easier to find and reference in future notes.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:3397a428-4af8-4a9e-84af-08824fb61d1d
:END:

##### 2) Concepts are “evergreen” in the sense that they’re pure. They’re not biased towards a particular domain, point of view, or time period. Thus, in theory, any note on a particular concept should only change if you learn more about the concept. Other than that, they’re sturdy building blocks for other ideas.
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:3086aa6d-ba3c-4a45-93ec-a8de5ad40235
:END:

##### 3) Concepts are the most “bang for your buck” in terms of note taking. They are, in theory, the most general Single Sources of Truth in existence. They’re an answer to the question, “What’s the largest overlap between all of these things?”[Densely-linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes_should_be_densely_linked): Concepts don’t exist in isolation – they’re compositions of other concepts.

:END:

### The more connections you find, The more the value of your network of ideas grows. In fact, actively pursuing connections between concepts creates pressure to [think carefully, foster learning, and discover insights](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Understanding_requires_effortful_engagement).

### Another tip: [Keep associations as fine-grained as possible](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Prefer_fine-grained_associations). In other words, lots of atomic notes with many inline connections is preferred to bloated (non-atomic) notes with few “foot-note” style (coarse-grained) connections between other notes.

##### Are there some notes that intrinsically are not Evergreen?

#### **How does one measure Evergreen-ness?** I can think of several metrics:

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:36536383-e2a8-4e43-af2a-c32b47754a04

##### accessibility: How easy is the note to understand? How easy is it to find relative to the notes it’s related to?

#### **What’s a good system for cleaning your knowledge database (e.g. removing duplicates and replacing with references to Evergreen notes)?**
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:2b963459-1bd4-4f0d-be90-73acff13b22d
:END:

#### **Andy has a note that says **[tags are an ineffective association structure](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Tags_are_an_ineffective_association_structure)**. Could tags still work beneficially here?**
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:de8a9de7-28cd-4eea-81c6-7faec7d51f4c

#### Could we just think of tags as cupid matchmakers for various entities?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:025f635c-829c-45bb-afee-385b86f88906
:END:

#### In other words, tagging is the first step to creating associations. At first, it goes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:03d7c08a-623f-42b5-84f6-08a9ebf4b671
:END:

#### entity 1 <–> tag <–> entity 2
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:cc24d2d8-4739-4e3f-9c5b-d83379d9fa5c
:END:

#### Perhaps the second step is a pass through everything you’ve tagged, and ask,
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:be0e4b70-8670-4503-8c18-8add997d1288
:END:

#### entity 1 <–> entity 2?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:2986132f-e19a-4f2e-a3dc-1667ba4799e8
:END:

#### This could be seen as a coalescing step. It might be the case that a small part of entity 1 is related to a small part of entity 2. We could refactor our notes to take out the one concept in common with entity 1 and 2, make it into an evergreen note, and then link to the evergreen note from entity 1 and entity 2.
