### Type:: [[Blog post]]

### Abstract::
#### Adarsh Pandit recently introduced me to the concept of the “gentleman scientist”: a researcher who funds their work independently. After digging around a bit, I was fascinated to learn that independent researchers were fairly common in the 18th and 19th centuries.

#### "in the 1930s, Alfred Lee Loomis used his Wall Street wealth to start a laboratory in his mansion, nicknamed "The Palace of Science", where physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Enrico Fermi collaborated." ([Eghbal 2018:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9ZVGB7P3?page=1))

#### "a 1998 Science article (paywalled here), called "Scientists Who Fund Themselves", profiling several contemporary researchers who fund their own work. Interestingly, many of them asked to remain anonymous, partly because they didn't want people to know they were wealthy, and partly, it seems, because it carried a hint of embarrassment. It's better to say you're funded by a big institutional grant than to admit it's coming out of your savings account." ([Eghbal 2018:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9ZVGB7P3?page=1))
