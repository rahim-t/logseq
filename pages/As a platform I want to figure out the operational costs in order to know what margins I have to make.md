title: As a platform I want to figure out the operational costs in order to know what margins I have to make

## At current prices to create a user on EOS will cost around 0.6 EOS which is around 2€ ( +CPU + Bandwith)

## Additionally we need to stake some EOS to operate the application
### Application is around 16kB big, which means we need ram for 160kB ~ 15 EOS = 50€

### Additionally I would add 10 EOS for Bandwith and CPU = 35

### In general the reccomendation is to have 1MB of RAM to run the application, which might be a little bit too much for us.

## So it's 85€ to run the app on a minimum level and 4€ per user ( depends on market prices of course). I would add 200€ worth of EOS in our account.
