## **[TiddlyBlink](https://giffmex.org/gifts/tiddlyblink.html).** Based on [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), this is a solid alternative. Linking to an inexisting page will create a new one, backlinks are shown as references below each note, you can open notes side by side, easily search through pages, and more. You can keep on using [[page]] to link to pages or create new pages, so you won’t be lost. Some people even use it as a static site generator. It’s completely open source, private, offline, and customisable. Because it’s just one HTML + JS file, you also have many [options](https://tiddlywiki.com/static/GettingStarted%2520-%2520Online.html) to host it in the cloud or sync it with Dropbox. It’s better to have a basic understanding of how the command line works to set it up, but then you’re good to go. [Here is a short guide to get started](https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial).

## **[TiddlyRoam](https://joekroese.github.io/tiddlyroam/).** Want the knowledge graph? TiddlyRoam combines TiddlyWiki, TiddlyBlink, and [TiddlyMap](https://github.com/felixhayashi/TW5-TiddlyMap) so you have most of the pure text-based functionalities of Roam as well as a live map of all the nodes in your knowledge graph. You can also install TiddlyMap separately.
