## Version 0.1

## **Credit from Honour:**
### 100 Honour = 10 Credit of [[Trust]] (hard cap of Credit of [[Trust]] is the sum of all offers, so it's not possible to have credit with no offers, so:
#### credit of [[Trust]] = min(honour / 10 + 1% liquidity, sum(offers))

### Each trade grants 1:1 honour points to the Offering Party (exception: see abuse potential)
#### e.g. Alice gives 100 € Cash to Bob for 100 [[Trust]], so she earns 100 Honour points, which increases her Credit of [[Trust]] for 10 [[Trust]]. Bob doesn't gain any honour.

## **Penalties:**

## Disappointed delivery:
### if disappointed: penalty is no Honour for transaction minus value gap*2 (trading volume * 2)

### eg.: has promised 100€ and not delivered – instead of +100 Honour -200

## Reject of Gift Request: ( 10% of requested trade volume?)

## -— ( after v0.01)

## Ignores Gift Request: (20% of requested trade volume?)

## Offerer changes his mind and cancels gift request after accepting it: 30% ?

## Bidder cancels Gift Request after "ack" during chat phase: No honour loss?

## **Honour Bets**

## When a member refers another member the referrer needs to make an honour bet on the referee:

## Which means the referrer needs to bet 2500 honour. If this exceeds his honour he needs to bet at least half of his honour, but there is no way he can bet less than 1000 Honour.

## The referer keeps his honour, the refered gets half the bet.
### e.g. The referer bets 10.000 honour on a referee. The referee receives 5.000 honour.

## If the referee looses honour, the refererer looses the same amount of honour

## If the referee wins honour, the referer wins the same amount of honour.

## Every time honour is lost or won, the amount of lost / won honour is removed from the bet. Until the bet is 0. Then the referees actions don't affect the referer anymore.
### e.g: The referer has 20.000 honour. The referer bets 10.000 honour on a referee. The referee receives 5.000 honour. The referee looses 1.000 honour,  which means the referer looses also 1.000 honour. The bet gets reduced to 9.000 honour. If the referee wins 500 honour, the referer gains 500 honour too, the bet get reduced to 8.500

## Later Versions

## Fast Response Bonus:

## Response time to call increases/decreases honour: if response within 25% of fastest responses to calls on platform 10% honour bonus (even if call refused, then only 90% honour reduction), if within 25 % slowest responses 10% honour loss.
### If Alices' honour decreases her Credit of [[Trust]] decreases accordingly. If it's negative she can gain increase it by paying back [[Trust]], create additional offers or by earning honour through trades.
#### Question: Should Alice get liquidated automatically if she still has [[Trust]] or shall we freeze [[Trust]] to cover the negative credit?
