## Umsetzung
### Staging Environment
#### https://network-app-staging.netlify.app/

#### Contract: [](https://jungle.bloks.io/account/ccazqyqjvxew?loadContract=true&tab=Tables&table=referrals&account=ccazqyqjvxew&scope=ccazqyqjvxew&limit=100)https://jungle.bloks.io/account/ccazqyqjvxew

### Production Environment

## Problem: [[Compliance]]

## [[Trust]] und [[Commitments]]

## Fokus auf langfristig, innovativ, bis hin zu [philanthropisch](((aa562613-47a9-406a-83d2-61b1b86be889)))
### je langfristiger und experimenteller, desto [geringerer Bezug zu kurzfristiger Gewinnentnahme](((dfa95f22-60dd-406a-afc3-c34d19933fa6)))

## Vorteil gegenüber herkömmlichen Spenden:
### Transparentere und kontrollierbarere [[Governance]]
#### Spender als Eigentümer von Projekten

### Crowdfunding-Vorteile durch Spender-Differenzierung
#### z.B. mehr Mitbestimmung

### Flexibilität hinsichtlich von Auslagerung/Umwandlung in kommerziellere Projekte, spätere Finanzierungsrunden etc.

## Feature-Ideen
### [[Treuhaenderische Aufbewahrung von Assets]]

### [[Forderungsmanagement wie Intarium]]

## So, der Baum ist implementiert, nur die Reports fehlen, welche in der v1 ja nicht drinnen sind. An den Pfeilen stehen die EOS Action Namen

## Offers for [[Trust]]
### liquidity, accommodation (goods, services)

### need to be specified (conditions)

### visibility can be restricted to minimum honour of taker

### examples:
#### Offer 100-10000€ for 1:1 coins in cash in Vienna after personal appointment in public place for Honour>amount (>100)

### To be specified: Type (accommodation, liquidity), kind (€,BTC,…), amount available, minimum/maximum amount per transaction, maximum market price, reputation conditions, other conditions (dates,locality,invoice,…), info needed (address,IBAN,…)

### offers can be accepted until amount exhausted by verified transactions

### Types are pre-specified on platform to exclude drugs, guns, scams
#### cash in all currencies

#### all cryptoassets

#### bank accounts around the world and payment balances

#### accomodation

#### gold, silver bullion (not jewelry) and accounts

#### goods, jobs and services are problematic – maybe only at later stage

### Changing of offers
#### should only be rearranged so that total liquidity remains the same (at current liquidity assessment)

#### Reduced liquidity leads to encouragement to change offers

#### If reduced liquidity not balanced by increasing some offers or changing of offers leads to reduction: proportional credit repayment necessary
##### if not enough [[Trust]] to repay credit: freezing of account except offers, encourage to make offers, "that cannot be refused" to quickly re-earn [[Trust]] (offers of highly liquid assets below market price)

## Bids of [[Trust]]
### wishlist of assets one would buy with coins received for own assets

### Bids have to be encouraged by automatic requests when new offers made, offers have to be encouraged according to bids (prepopulated selection menu)
#### on new kinds of offers pop-up for users if they are interested, if not, at what price

## if offers match bid and [[Trust]] available:
### trade is proposed to bidder

### if trade is called, amounts are distributed among offers (so that if all offerers accept, amount = called amount minus typical percentage of refused calls)

### if traders accept, instructions are sent to both sides and temporary communication channel is opened

### price is set at average market price (+/- specified dis/agio) between price at call of bidder and price at acceptance of offerer

### if so many offerers refuse that amount is not reached, additional calls made for missing amount to offerers who have already accepted.

### If call refused by offerer or no response
#### honour deducted for refused (missed) trades = fixed sum plus [[Trust]] deducted for immediate partial credit repayment plus liquidity reduction.

#### encouragement to change offers

### Response time to call increases/decreases honour: if response within 25% of fastest responses to calls on platform 10% honour bonus (even if call refused, then only 90% honour reduction), if within 25 % slowest responses 10% honour loss.

## review of transaction
### If both sides accept, both can review: confirm quantity/quality (in terms of coins - e.g. execution of job offered was worth more or less than paid)/specifications

### better than expected, as expected, disappointed

### if disappointed: penalty is no Honour for transaction minus value gap*2

### ex.: has promised 100€ and not delivered – instead of +100 Honour -200

### Posting to be written on experience by both sides (optional unless disappointed)

### Review can be contested —> conflict

## Communication channels
### no direct contact of users, only if bids match offers and trade accepted by both communication possible

### first automatic communication like "enter your wallet address/IBAN"

### for wire transfer propose as payment reference: "Contribution"

### private communication channel only opened if selected by one party

### when trade reviewed communication channel deleted (with all messages)

### if one disappointed and other contests new channel opened with mediators

## Complicated trades:
### I offer 110.000 [[Trust]] if you buy my real-world asset with market value 100.000 for 200.000 plus legal fees.

### I buy your gold coins, but do not take delivery now.

### I offer 500 [[Trust]] if you take delivery of gold coins for me to safe-keep them.

### Non-delivered assets transferable?
#### QR codes in app for verification of real-world transaction

## if [[Honor]] becomes negative:
### liquidation of coins to repay credit, freezing of account except offers, encourage to make offers, "that cannot be refused" to quickly re-earn Honour (offers of highly liquid assets below market price)

### if enough [[Trust]] to cover open credit, account just remains frozen until enough Honour re-earned

### in not enough [[Trust]], additionally referral consequences

## Abuse potential:
### Two users agree off-platform on exotic offers/bids that are matched to generate fictional trades which increase their respective Honour

### Alternative 1:
#### Number of different trade partners * 5 = limit of honour-increasing transactions per user

### Alternative 2: Honour increase capped for trade between two parties? Once cap reached honour can only be increased by trading with others. Once honour increased by trade with others higher, cap lifted to new highest level.
#### Traded 1000 with one out total four users: 500 honour increase (cap 500)

#### Traded 1000 with 2nd user: 1000 honour increase

#### Traded 1000 again with first user: 500 honour increase (cap 1000)

#### Traded 1000 with third user: 1000 honour increase

### Alternative 3: Honour increased by trade volume per user (averaging)
#### Traded 1000 with one out total four users: 250 honour increase

#### Traded 1000 with 2nd user: 500 honour increase

#### Traded 1000 again with first user: 250 honour increase

#### Traded 1000 with third user: 750 honour increase

## Urgency
### in case of urgent need of liquidity: set maximum agio

### every day until deadline, bid increased until maximum agio

### highlighted to other users: auction – first one to respond gets bid (if only part offered, then agio is only paid out if needed amount reached)

## Offering Assets and bidding trust
### Problem: Anonymous [[Exchange of physical goods]] 
#### [[Cachebox]]

### Problem: [[transaction costs]] differ depending on [[asset class]], transaction type, and potentially specific transaction
#### constant fees possible for non-sepa-payments, crypto transactions
##### different minimum fees for crypto transactions depending on platform

##### can be estimated very often by [[offeror of asset]] 

#### non-constant, individual transaction fees when physical transport necessary

#### no fees for most p2p-fiat instant transactions
##### paypal family and friends

##### n26 moneybeam

##### revolut 

##### monese (?)

### The [[offeror of asset]] knows best what the costs for the transaction of the offered asset might be #claim

:END:

### Problem: There might be offers with no bidders 
#### e.g. because the [[bidder of trust]] has to take action
##### e.g. deliver payment receipt

#### If there is no bidder of trust to an offer, a disagio should be applied on the to-be-exchanged trust in order to incentivize bidding. #claim

### Problem: There might be bids for an asset with no [[offeror of asset]]
#### e.g. because the bidder asks for a special delivery

#### If there is no offeror of asset to a bid, an agio should be applied on the to-be-offered asset in order to incentivize offering. #claim
