## [[exchange of talent]]: currently by [[offers]] on [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] in [[Plattform-Projekt]] #technology

### As a User of [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] I don't want to see [[expired [[offers]]]] and [[bids]] for [[exchange of talent]] so the view doesn't get messy. #story

### As long as the technical implementation of the exchange of talents is done without a bidding process, the workflow for [[estimation of [[Stories]]]] has to be done in person. #claim #management 

## [[Stories]] tree as structured [[backlog]] #management #technology

:END:
### Most of [[backlog]] [[Stories]] are not relevant for technological development, but for management vision

### Many [[backlog]] [[Stories]] will temporarily be #done without development
#### "hacks" like using Roam to focus on more important stuff

### Tree of Stories arises when matching [[Stories]] to different [[feature]] of [[Plattform-Projekt]] 

## Linked blocks are shown in random order on page of tag or wiki-link and cannot be rearranged, which is ok for discovery but bad for structuring
### to structure discovered blocks have to be manually embedded on page
#### Blocks that are important have to be embedded from linked and unlinked mentions and brought into correct hierarchical order

#### can be done using kanban-board resp. backlinks in page filtered for #story

#### later including [[Governance]]

### [[acceptance of [[Stories]]]], including sizing and commissioning
#### At the beginning work-around needed: 
##### {{embed ((((bef33e88-90fe-4f6f-a629-884239a86693))))}}

#### Later, this should work anonymously and with [[Governance]]

### work with alias: [estimate Stories]([[size [[Stories]]]])

## [[namespaces]] in [[Roam]]: 
### https://twitter.com/matiassingers/status/1272391076129587200?s=20

### ctrl-c ctrl-l cycles through display modes for internal links with slashes [[quick/brown/fox]]  → [[q/b/fox]] → [[fox]]

### when I play along with this by creating Datastructure/Tree and Plant/Tree and then autocomplete a reference to one of them the namespace is shown. Using ^c^l toggles between full-namespace (e.g. [[Plant/Tree]], first letter (e.g. [[P/Tree]] and nothing (e.g. [[Tree]]).

#### Under each vision, I ask: what am I pretty sure I have to *maintain* in order to achieve this vision

## [[evergreen note]]
### Example for titles
#### how the introduction of  cars/trucks lead to an increase in the number of horses in American cities. What would be a good evergreen note title?
##### Evergreen note titles should be clear about what the content is about, such as “The introduction of cars/trucks led to an increase of horses in American cities”. Then you could reference this title easily since you know the note’s argument (See [[[[evergreen notes]]' title is like API]]).

##### Andy's note titles are, in many cases, embeddable phrases that can be used in a variety of contexts. They are typically, nouns, or terse statements.

##### So to rephrase some of those:
###### horses remained prevalent into the era of cars

###### horse ownership increased with car ownership

###### cities structured life around the co-existence of horses and cars

###### cars were a motivating factor in decline of horse usage (counterexample)

###### Horses filled the gap for mediocre engines (as-is)

##### Aside from the API example, a more literary framing is that [[evergreen notes]] are less titles that refer to notes and more so pieces of language that refer to themselves, and the note provides more detail.

## [[pages versus blocks]] in [[Roam]] 
### Pages, according to [[Conor White-Sullivan]] are just blocks with heading, or "Global blocks". What makes "pages" or topics unique is much less that they are a place to write (you can zoom into a block to get page experience)What is different is that they have unique titles, and thus unlinked mentions, and they float outside any context.

## Add [[daily notes]] on top or below?
### [[Roam]] automatically adds imports etc. below, so that is probably recommended workflow. Looking for shortcut to add new block at bottom of daily notes

## [[Even as a non-native speaker prefer English for [[exchange of ideas]]]] English first, German as second version for [[evergreen notes]]?

## [[[[Anonymity]] has advantages for the [[exchange of ideas]]]]
