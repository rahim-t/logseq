### creating a new [[database]] for each [[project]] then is not feasible, [[Roam]] only allows for three [[database]]s and moving between them is not possible - they are separated silos.

### Maybe use another tool for [[project]] management and governance, for example [[Notion]] (for now), which means separation of platform for [[exchange of ideas]] into two different platforms between which content is manually moved: [[Roam]] for [[exchange of ideas]] that is exploratory and produces insights that are gathered into [[Stories]] and [[priority]] and [[claim]]
#### Are [[priority]] a kind of [[claim]]?

#### [[Roam]] may allow selective sharing in the future - best would be to be able to share [[page]] which gives access to everything the [[page]] link to, but no other [[page]]
##### even a tiny overlap will thus give total access to all [[page]], so this is not feasible

##### any kind of access criterion based on [[tag]] is unlikely because difficult to implement and follow in workflow

##### all [[shareholder]] of [[project]]s invited to [[Roam]] must be [[shareholder]] at least of the [[project]]s most vulnerable to public access, which are [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] and [[Cachebox]]

##### [[shareholder]] of other [[project]] need to be limited to other tool for [[project]] management and governance
###### This means [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] and platform for governance of a [[project]] are different [[project]]s
####### which means only [[shares]] of [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] can be directly integrated on it for now, [[shares]] for all other [[project]]s must be tracked outside it, but can be part of offers and bids on [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]]

### How to move blocks and replace with reference at original location in [[Roam]]: press alt and drag-and-drop block right above or below - this creates the same block as a reference above or below. Then drag-and-drop original block to new location. This is what I do with [[daily notes]] when I want to add them to pages because they seem important enough to do so.

## Weekly meeting to go through important ideas that were developed in [[Roam]] over the last week may be a good idea
### even better would be selective ad hoc discussion according to relevance
#### which may happen naturally anyway

#### avoid meetings if it means wasting time of people because they are not as involved in the topics discussed

### a great tool for [[exchange of ideas]] would automatically check if two or more people focus at the same moment on related ideas or sources and open a channel for impromptu discussion

### another thing would be the request of a [[didactic aid]] by a reader - often ideas written down by others need further explanation or even a discussion to fully understand them

### better are maybe [[sparring session]] with 2-3 people at a time, which are joint note-taking sessions as concepts and ideas are discussed
#### [[sparring session]] are joint contributions of [[Wisdom]] which may result in 1+1>2
##### maybe there should also be a way for joint contributions to solve [[problem]]s because right now problems can only be solved isolated which doesn't allow [[team work]] 
###### indeed, but for [[exchange of talent]] many conceptional problems are still to be solved. It is unclear if most problems are actually part of product development which is usually only feasible in [[team work]].
####### The offer of paying for freelancers on upwork, for example, is difficult because freelancers will usually get back with [[question]], and specification is a gradual process for most problems but the simplest ones (which are so highly specified that they are [[code for people]])

##### may a [[project]] bid [[Trust]] for [[sparring session]] to advance [[exchange of ideas]]? This would be a payment by the hour

## [[sparring session]] of [[Rahim Taghizadegan]] and [[Philipp Bogensberger]]
### Ventures begin as research [[project]]

### Funding of ventures has many problems and bad incentives in current solutions

### most ventures fail: what happens to the knowledge gained?

### synergies of learnings between [[project]]s: [[neuronal reputation]] for [[selective visibility]] of ideas

### way to monetize [[project]] knowledge through earning [[prize]]s

### [[project]] does not need name or description (investor presentation), but rather a map of [[claim]] to see if there are shared premises and interests
#### [[claim]] etc. not enough (how can [[Wisdom]] act as value signal?), but [[Skill]] and [[Trust]] raised as value signals

#### [[shares]] sold against [[Trust]] are signals of commitment
##### commitment separates more academic [[project]] from more entrepreneurial [[project]]
###### plus seeking market proof by willingness-to-pay from customer
####### customer and investor is not a clear-cut line, see crowdfunding
######## employee, investor, customer are rather overlapping roles

####### someone willing to pay to learn from [[project]] may be a kind of customer as well
######## payment through [[prize]]s on own [[project]], not micropayments, but signalling importance of contributions in advance as an incentive for contributions

## [[prize]]: what if contributions are lacking, will [[prize]] [[Trust]] be lost? May it  follow a logic of bids and offers, whereby some [[Honor]] may be lost if those who had expressed willingness to contribute did not contribute at all?
### expressed willingness to contribute as precondition to earn [[prize]] money?

### minimum number of contributors necessary for [[prize]] to be paid out?
