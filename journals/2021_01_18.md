## #topic #tag #UI #[[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
### Bsp. für Differenzierung
#### China as a geopolitical power shaping our lives

#### China as a model in politics

#### China as a location for investment

#### China as a location for living

### Reihung wichtig: "top ten" sources, arguments ...

### AI for checking content of node with ranked topics of interest
#### node containing "Peking" should automatically show 1. as likeliest node to relate to

### [[node]]s = cards

### #UI for #[[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
#### quick commands by 
##### swiping left 
###### + menu

##### swiping right 
###### + menu

##### short press

##### long press

##### commands:
###### attach new node underneath (note, counter-argument, ...)

###### attach new node above (summary, container?)

###### edit/correct node and change type

###### relate as relevant for topic (with quick assessment +,-,?)

###### multi-select - short press
####### additional command after multiple nodes selected: combine

###### separate node in two (then select position)

###### focus on (show relations) - long press

###### add new node ranked in context of other nodes
####### (new quote between/after quote, new source that is more/less relevant than other sources)

##### swipe right for relations and swipe left for editing
###### relations menu: show best guess node (topic), node search & selector and commands 
####### + ... most relevant

####### - ... little relevant

####### ? ... maybe relevant

####### x ... irrelevant

###### editing menu:
####### +↑ new node related to this one (note, element)

####### +↓ new node this one relates to (summary, container)

####### +⤴︎ new node ranked above this one (in same relation)

####### +⤵︎ new node ranked below this one (in same relation)

####### ✎ ... edit (= propose node to replace this one)

####### ✂︎ split node in two 
######## then let cursor be placed for split position

###### editing menu if multiple nodes selected:
####### +↑ new node related to these (note, element)

####### +↓ new node these relate to (summary, container)

####### ⫘ concat nodes
######## select concat character: ellipsis ([...]), space, line break, none (save last selection as default)

### keep outliner logic by directed relevance relation
#### node A is relevant for node B =  B contains A as relevant, with B being the summary, parent, container

#### node B is relevant for node A = A contains B as relevant, with A being the summary, parent, container

#### AI auto-containers for topics: e.g. China containing all places within China

### example: translate this outline to new #UI
#### Project defined "platform for exchange of ideas"
##### contains topic "UI" (as "is very relevant for project")
###### contains "logical elements"
####### contains "nodes"

####### contains "relations"

####### note related to this: "Is this really part of UI?"

###### contains "commands as functions"

###### contains "command interfaces"
####### note related to this: "Is this the right term to contain menus etc?)

####### synonym "buttons and menus"

### entity "me" as end-point for relevance relations: topics and projects that are relevant to me
#### how to distinguish between:
##### this source is, according to my assessment, the most relevant one for this topic

##### this source is to me the most relevant one for this topic

##### maybe really the same thing and no distinction necessary

### 

## Instead of [[Honor]] bet cost of [[Trust]] for [[Referral]] as Trust bet?
### give stronger incentive to make good referrals

### If someone I refer does not fulfil his obligations, I am not lacking honor, but judgment

### [[Honor]] is actually dependability

## [[prize]]s for [[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
### "charge" [[topic]] with [[Trust]] to incentivize good content
#### paid out according to relevance over time
##### maybe: pay out a quarter of remaining total every month?
###### example: only one person corrects one comma in one node and gets quarter of prize immediately?
####### maybe: weight edits by number of characters and rank prizes divided by relevance of contributions until now
