## Realized a new kind of link: alias. This type allows the linking to a subject without using the original title. I can link zu [[Mises MEM Lviv]] but without using these words, because it makes no sense or I want not use the whole name in the text. I can write, that the {{alias [[MisesMEMLviv]]MEMinLemberg}} will be a great venue when it is established.

## [[Even as a non-native speaker prefer English for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
### [[translation]] is the integration of thought into a living context of discourse
#### the language is therefore dependent on the audience, not the writer

#### the language is therefore dependent on the output, not the input

#### [[translation]] implies much more than the change of language in the narrow sense, it is also a change of language in the broad sense: adapting thought to the vocabulary, context, problems, level, attention etc. of the audience

#### writing for an audience does not always make for good writing: it reduces authenticity
##### but then why do you write?
###### 1. [[Schreiben als Werkzeug des Denkens]] to structure your own thought
####### this needs [[translation]] in the other direction: reformulate input to adapt it to your thought = your language in the broad sense

####### to me, structuring my thought in English or German is not the same in mode of thinking, but the same in difficulty
######## it is switching that is difficult

######## English writing by non-natives will always need polishing by natives if same perfection is required
######### this level of perfection is only required for traditional publication, lots of blogs of non-native writers that have their quirks but are readable without costly native editing
########## using LanguageTool when writing is helpful to avoid misspelling and obvious style errors

########## online publishing would allow for crowd-editing if better tools were used
########### tool decisions seem to imply platform decisions and are therefore limited by network effects
############ maybe the tendency to corporate/convenience platforms hampers the adaption of innovative tools
############# what makes [[git]] such a universal platform for code?

###### 2. to enter into a conversation – to argue. This implies [[translation]] to the thought of the addressed audience
####### audience is too passive, circle is better
######## as there is no [[public discourse]], private circles of discourse need to be built up and addressed

###### 3. to produce something valuable to foreigners in exchange
####### market is a bad analogy for the [[exchange of ideas]]
######## paid or monetized content does not constitute an [[exchange of ideas]]
######### it is mostly entertainment in a convenient format - most payment nowadays for this convenience factor of delivery
########## here all nested bullet-points are [[claim]]
########### bullet-points that are not [[claim]] are not autonomous, but require the context of higher-order points

########### it would look better if the bullet-points were block references rather than [[page]]. But blocks lack titles: [[[[evergreen notes]]' title is like API]]. [[page]] have a title which summarizes and is dynamically linked (title is changed automatically at all occurrences)
############ As an alternative start each block with a sentence that summarizes its content?
############# and then nest all explications?

############# and then "upgrade" title block to heading?
############## as [[RG]] has done here:
############### ((1b322c6e-1470-482b-aabb-f6d84d01e1a9))

############## problem: heading is something else than just a title, it is the start of a section.

########### the parent block of this one is, like this one, a side-comment or meta-comment which disrupts the flow of argument. How to format such diversions?
############ maybe just collapse them
############# nesting possible answers to [[question]], a new block for each answer
############## use blocks to keep as atomic as possible

############# it would make more sense to use heading not as universal formatting of a block, but a context-specific increase in prominence of a block
############## the opposite of a heading in this sense would be useful to mark diversions by making them less prominent: greying them out for example, default collapsing, hiding in view and just showing number of hidden blocks which are revealed upon clicking
############### this then might be the way to go for commenting

### Now, I would like to have a way to comment — I would like to congratulate for such a fabolous piece of demonstration on how to document the progress of thoughts. Although it is not easy to nachvollziehen (reenact, reproduce, reconstruct???); it is possible, but it is not easy and takes time. One has to read, think, reproduce the thought and finally put all together. Interesting. However, **Chapeau!!!**

## Biggest problem of [[Obsidian]]: file logic leads to less [[Atomicity]]
### each paragraph should be a markdown file

### files have file titles: [[Obsidian]] could take first few words as title like [[Scrivener]] default for blocks, even all words of a paragraph (for paragraphs shorter than maximum filename length) which would make for very long, but unique file names
#### it can change file name later to a better summary due to the automatic update of all links

### the arrangement of blocks would then have to be stored in other files, which would be outline or topic files
#### big problem if one paragraph is split or others are added
##### each written paragraph would have to be simultaneously a markdown file with its text as title and content and an outline file containing a link to the content file, which effectively triples all paragraph texts (as title, content, link) until summarized

##### separate atomic content from info about its location (as [[Roam]] seems to do)
###### outline files could define other relations between content files than order and nesting

###### example: writing two paragraphs under each other as creation of two blocks and a relation between these two blocks
####### ((c37e9b5b-e776-4427-960f-aabc5ef1457b))

####### [[relation]] files would contain sets of references to block files and their relations
######## ```clojure
filename of block1
filename of block2
filename of relation
```

######## ((c6d0c938-c2e5-48d6-be3a-0b3f9067afcb))

######## exponential number of files necessary, scanning all files for block references may take to long
######### maybe better to include relations in each block file and not have extra relation file
########## example: writing two paragraphs would then create:
########### file1 with text of first paragraph as filename and the following content:
############ ```clojure
text of first paragraph
relation nr. 1: "followed by"
filename of second paragraph
```

########### file2 with text of second paragraph as filename and the following content:
############ ```clojure
text of second paragraph
relation nr. 1: "follows after"
filename of first paragraph
```

## easy nesting with tab leads to different kind of writing
### blocks usually do not just follow each other as paragraphs follow each other in normal writing
#### rather multiple blocks follow the first one and some blocks follow other blocks

#### a block being written underneath another block is no meaningful relation – only if it is nested does it belong to the block above. Otherwise, it does not matter if it is above, below or on another page.
##### so "follows after" as a relation means is "nested under"
###### what does it mean to be nested under a block? 
####### a relation like a link in a mind map

#### **We provide a digital space for a closed, private community, via a mobile app, which enables people to trade with one another, among other functions.**

#### a __blockchain__ is a kind of open, distributed ledger, where everybody who has a copy is auditing it constantly, and **its chief feature is to promote high trust transactions between strangers**.

#### However, the ledger itself is only available to those who are within the community, which would be exclusive to people whose loved ones have those special needs, or provide support services to that community (such as ABA therapists, respite caregivers, etc. — all would require approval from the community administrators before being able to access the platform).

#### Our platform supports crypto payments, but also barter systems.

#### we charge a marginal transaction fee to use these services, but a substantial portion of each transaction fee actually goes back to the closed community itself, which serves as a source of revenue for the community, essentially crowd funding their own services to meet the needs of their own people.

#### a community can achieve profitability in just a few months, with just a few thousand members having two to three transactions a month.

### Seven essential functions, pre-integrated and customized into a single user experience
#### Digital Identity

#### “chat-style” or “forum-line” communications

#### buy or sell goods or services utilizing high-trust private or public blockchain

#### secure accounts for storing individual digital records of tokens or other forms of assets or currency

#### Every transaction or trade is evaluated for performance, rated through multiple criteria, including: satisfaction, timeliness, responsiveness, and 14 other subjective and objective criteria

#### built-in means to arbitrate or resolve it using a private administrative process

## Every-one needs his own private place for [[daily notes]]. Not having one central inbox for notes causes a lot of friction.
### some notes would then be exported to a public place when and where they fit in

### a public [[platform for [[exchange of ideas]]]] would need great ease of connectivity
#### well-structured maps of relevant topics where one can easily add to from own private notes

#### problem: if pushing notes from private inbox to public platform feels like "publishing" the barrier is too great
##### so that seems to call for an integration of private and public tool, which is less modular and more burdened by network effects.

### a workflow may look like that: 
#### check [[platform for [[exchange of ideas]]]] for relevant points of connection ([[question]] and claims by others, topic maps) 

#### translate terms to own terms in private Zettelkasten

#### search for those terms and gather relevant notes

#### copy and paste to [[platform for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
##### feed open [[question]], claims for debate, relevant notes from private into public Zettelkasten

#### connect to notes in public Zettelkasten

### separation of private and public is really a barrier if not [[git]]-like with easy selective sharing

### best solution would of course be one place for all notes with selective visibility
#### notes are private or related to specific [[project]], where project may be a joint research project, but also joint venture.
##### every block would be marked according to where it belongs, with one note potentially being marked as relevant for multiple [[project]]s
###### using [[tag]] for this seems easiest, but then they cannot be used for free associations. Best would be an attribute that can be quickly selected from list of [[project]]s that one is [[shareholder]] of with default set to private.

###### any solution like that would need a rebuild of [[Roam]]-functionality
####### maybe using [[Roam]]-API could be a way whereby private databases are automatically synced with [[project]]-database according to [[tag]]
######## everyone having a [[Roam]] account is expensive and a huge security issue

###### alternative: rebuild [[Obsidian]] with block-logic instead of [[page]]-logic

## some [[claim]] really are just one sentence without further explication
### therefore length is not the difference between drafts and [[evergreen notes]]
#### "therefore" and nesting constitute a relation between two [[claim]]
