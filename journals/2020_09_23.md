### Import
#### Want to do some quick comparisons between [[It's Time To Build]] and the [[Roam White Paper]]
##### Goals::
###### One of the underlying motivations for [[Roam]] is to build a more [[Anti-Fragile]] or at least [[Resilient]] [[Civilization]], and I suspect there are differences of opinion between myself and [[Marc Andreesen]] on the what the underlying cause is to the current failures of our institutions and what the path is to build better institutions
####### I suspect we're pretty closely aligned though

####### I want to get more articulate about what I think the problems are, and work a bit off his thinking and past writing I did with [[Richard Meadows]] to do so

###### Provide a demo video showing how I use Roam to approach a thinking problem
####### a problem of exploring past writing, and current writing to come to a more articulate position / have new ideas. 

##### DONE #[[Choice]] How to approach the problem
###### Options:: 
####### Start fresh by writing what I think the problems are
######## List it out in some sort of structure
######### TODO #[[Choice]] what structure
########## Options:: 
########### Free form, essay style, structure later

########### List problems
############ then reasons

########### List set of claims about the world, then group

########## Decision::

####### Start by collecting the problems from the [[Roam White Paper]] that I think are relevant to this topic, using that collection to figure out the things I haven't yet said

######### Decision::((d7b77544-c9d5-4078-8ac5-1e8f1c1dd165))

####### Start by going through [[It's Time To Build]] and pulling out the most interesting points related to this topic
######## TODO #[[Choice]] What to call this topic - how to tag this set of thinking
######### Goals::
########## Tag the whole project so can continue this theme in the future.

######### Options:: 
########## Failure of institions

########## Why the west couldn't handle Covid-19

########## Filing Cabinet institions

########## Defer to later

## for [[Conor White-Sullivan]] [[twitter]] is public front-end of [[Roam]], so the search for a better [[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]] may be rather for a better twitter than a better Roam.
### you cannot improve on immense network effects unless offering much higher relevance

### a better tool would probably use [[twitter]] as a source and be better at connecting thoughts
#### automatic import of tweets and threads, with handles as synonyms of author names
