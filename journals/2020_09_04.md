## [[[[scholarium.at]]-Inhalte als [[digital garden]]]] must be protected (Useraccounts from Wishlist/Wordpress); for new book (external publisher) a password protected would be enough
### .htaccess is being developed by Apache; 
#### What is [[.htaccess]]:
The .htaccess file is a configuration file that controls how a webserver responds to various requests.

##### No, it's done on server-level

#### But this shouldn't be a problem - you have to deploy it anyway

### Auth0
#### See [Demo](https://sleepy-haibt-f5d703.netlify.app/) 

#### How to: see [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-theme-auth-app/)

#### I really like Auth0, it's a great service and I used it for the first prototype of [[asset-exchange]] but I don't think it's the right tool for this usecase
##### It's not suitable to give [[scholarium]] users access

##### It's an overkill to give access to digital content

### **Gatsby with Wordpress Auth**
#### See [this tutorial](https://www.dajocarter.com/posts/wordpress-authentication-with-gatsby/)
##### I have the impression, you want it the other way around (this tutorial shows how to use gatsby auth within a wordpress site) [[September 7th, 2020]] 

#### WP has to be self-hosted

#### Pulls data from self-hosted WordPress sites, or sites hosted on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/)

#### Works with Wordpress REST API
##### this will soon be replaced. the method will become deprecated

### Password Protection only on server side possible?
#### .htaccess and .htpasswd don't work on localhost; Apache needed;

#### [netlify offers pw protection ](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/)

#### digital garden incl. .htaccess and .htpasswd code ready see [here](https://github.com/flacchini14/htaccess-gatsby)

### One of the biggest problem with selling digital goods is the question how to ensure that the user doesn't pass on his access to his friends, a solution could be to tie it to a login he wouldn't pass on, like
#### facebook / twitter / google login, so using OAuth2 + one time redeemable code could be a solution

#### Accept cryptocurrencies as payment and let the user login with the private key of wallet he used to make the payment (not sure if there is already an established protocol for this, but if not, we should build it :p )

## Working on a book project
### gathering information with/on Roam — mainly expcerpts from books, articles, blogpost, etc. — are my own books usable sources? — yes, of course.
#### Question: The whole book, or is it possible/necessary to make an excerpt from my own book?

#### How would this work? — If I can extract the core essence of my book (which is how I define excerpts), then the book could have been that short, couldn't it?

#### Are there excerpts of [Helden, Schurken, Visionäre: Entrepreneure waren gestern – jetzt kommen die Contrepreneure.](https://amzn.to/3boKatd) or [Wirtschaft wirklich verstehen](https://amzn.to/3h1WjVY) available at Scholarium?

### less atomized blocks — using em-dash to pause between the more atomized fragment.
