## Now that I am gathering more and more articles, it seems that it makes much more sense to use tags at the end of each paragraph. Thus it makes sense to grey them out.
### I wondered if it is necessary to tag or link each special word (keyword) in a text. E.g. there is a text on service design and therefore the term "service design" appears several times. should I use [[ for every appearance? No, but I can include the tag #Servicedesign at the end of the paragraph (together with a bunch of other keywords for this paragraph). As it is greyed out, it doesn't disturb reading. On the other hand, this tag helps me to find this specific paragraph (which is in fact a "Zettel")
#### the recommended use for multi-word tags is #[[service design]] (with [[) - or do you usually write this term as one word (which seems Germanized)?

#### You are right – »Servicedesign« is how I write in German, [[service design]] is correct, because we write in English on this plattform.

### The standard tags, that we thought about to define are attributes – Nat Eliason created a "Metadata" page and summarizes all used Attributes on this page so that they can easily copied to book or article excerpts. with typing  double : :  and a character, one get a list of recommended (or already used) attributes. In that sense "Claim" is rather an attribute as a tag. But maybe this was already ascertained.

## I dared to change the format of one of Rahims blocks from yesterday and want to politely suggest that we **use H3 or other headline tags for new topics** in the daily notes. In that case I made **"Fundraising ..." a headline,** so it is easier to see, that this is a new different topic. The same would be useful for the discussion on "calendly vs. doodle" – as a headline, it is easier to understand: new topic, different mind set, and the reader can consider if he can add value to the discussion.

### Every top-level bullet point in [[daily notes]] is a new topic and very few are as short as a title should be
#### best to use collapsed view for overview of new topics

#### Every top level note opens a new thread of thoughts on one topic. If one will understand the original row of thoughts, one collapses all top level bullits and voila. 

#### Two reasons why it might make sense to use headlines –  might be useful especially for (or only on) the daily notes sections for a better understanding at first glance (for sure not so on pages) 
##### There are different types of notes in [[August 25th, 2020]]: 
###### Notes – some sentences; 

###### and headlines – just some words that obviously work as cover of the notes in the level bellow.

###### The first one can stand for themselves, they work also without the sub-bullets, notes of the second type are nothing w/o their sub-bullets.

##### I can identify at least three top-level notes in [[August 25th, 2020]] that are this other kind of note; they are headlines. Only these headlines, covers, should be made to H3 or so, all other notes are notes with sub notes, they should not become headlines, because they aren't. They are main thoughts with connected thoughts.

### a recommended workflow for [[Roam]] is to nest bullet points under wiki links, thus using [[page]] as titles of subjects

### my [[Roam]] custom css highlights wiki links more prominently

#### "Technologically, you could build the Coinbase/Twitter mashup today, in which every user does casual pseudonymous microinvesting and tracks their progress on a public leaderboard. It may take a generation for crypto people to fill the relevant regulatory and policy roles, though."
