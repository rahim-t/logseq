## [Brainstorming | Tour](https://brainstorming.com/tour) #[[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
### A brainstorming session is not about answering questions. Rather, the purpose is to jointly contribute valuable information that could get us closer to the session’s goal.

### Components of a brainstorming session:
#### A clear goal (the big picture) that would be achievable if we had the right information.

#### Insight. What should people know before they can meaningfully contribute toward the session’s goal?

#### Call to action. How can you convince people that your goal is worthy of their time and brainpower?

### A creative contribution can be any valuable information that could get us closer to the goal of the session. It Could be an original thought, reference to existing research, a connection found between other contributions, etc. The title should summarize the contribution.

### an idea that you share on this platform, is a nearly complete picture with most of the pieces in place. People will provide the few missing pieces in the form of their feedback, suggestions for improvements, clever use case scenarios, etc.
