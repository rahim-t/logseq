### https://blog.bitmex.com/announcing-the-bitmex-user-verification-programme/
#### "Cryptocurrencies have come a long way in their 10 years of existence. Today, user identity verification is increasingly expected in order to meet evolving international regulatory standards, and is an important part of building trust in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Practical customer security is greatly enhanced by identity verification, allowing BitMEX support personnel to reliably verify the actual owner of an account in the event of a dispute, hack, or incapacitation."
