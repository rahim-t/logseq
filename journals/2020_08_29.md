## How to do block referencing in [[Obsidian]]: (https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-do-block-referencing-in-obsidian/831/6) 
### Create a block reference by wrapping the target block—or sentence, or phrase, even—in `[square brackets]`. Then, create a new note with this link. There! Now you can reference that “block” elsewhere.

### blocks referenced in this way must abide by the filenaming rules of your OS.

### the lines of text are not uniquely addressable without additional workarounds, some of which may violate the principles behind working with plain text.

### Roma’s block linking is possible because it doesn’t “have” or “use” files. However, the files exist as data objects. Every block is its own file. In Roam, you just can’t see those files.

### This is actually the same thing Roam does, under the hood. The only difference is that block linking here requires an extra step when creating the block reference (initiating the link) and when going back to find the original note (this requires two steps instead of one).

### Descriptive filenames facilitate interoperability. It makes it easier to open and work on your ideas in Obsidian directories in, say, iA Writer.

### If we abandoned filenames-as-links, the best approach would probably be to generate unique universal identifiers for filenames. Titles of notes could then come from H1s

### I suspect that the community will be divided about such a decision. Arguably it would violate one of the principles at the core of the app—ownership (and usefulness) of your files outside of Obsidian.

### At the same time, it __is__ sad that you can’t use apostrophes, colons, question marks, or other characters as block references

### I do think having blocks as separate notes is fine - it actually makes sense in a way - but agree with others above that there should be a way to display the note content as the link without it being the actual title/file name.

### A good workflow for this could be a hotkey that takes a “block” (sentence/paragraph or whatever, really) and prompts you for a shorter note title/file name or creates one automatically (could be the zettelkasten time stamp), ideally this would be a setting since preferences may vary here.

## for [[digital garden]]
### selective Export from [[Roam]]: run script on JSON file
#### ```python
for child in children:
  if '#selectiontag' in child.get('string', '').lower():
    print(child['string'])
```
##### https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-25-roam-json-export/

#### this necessitates using [[tag]] as selectors of views, not as references to subjects
##### [[Use [[tag]] to filter blocks according to user focus]]
###### Use [[tag]] to indicate for each block which [[project]] it refers to

:END:

#### [about - Stian's Notes](https://notes.reganmian.net/about?stackedPages=%2Ftechnology-of-stian%27s-notes) 
##### This site is based on two main technologies. First I take all my notes on Roam, and export the JSON.

##### Then I use **[roam-export](https://github.com/houshuang/roam-export)** to process the output. This script is pretty messy, but has a lot of neat features

###### automatically resolve embeds and block-embeds

###### queries
####### (I've got this working, but it's not quite integrated yet)

###### advanced link handling
####### use a heuristic to see where I've added an external URL to a topic

####### for pages that are not part of the export, either convert internal URLs to external URLs, or turn them bold (to distinguish from links that actually go to internal pages with content)

###### automatically determine pages to export
####### right now, it exports all pages linked directly from the about page, as well as any page or block that has the `public` tag. (If the tag is top-level on a page, the whole page is exported, but if I have a block on a daily page I want to export, I can just add that tag, and the whole block+children is exported as a page)

##### Finally, I send the output to Gatsby, using a **Aengus McMillin**'s **gatsby-theme-brain** and **Aravind Balla**'s **gatsby-theme-andy**, which gives the nice theme and automatic link preview.

##### I have many ideas on how to improve this
###### Commenting, maybe even inline (using **[Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)** or something else?

###### Tag some pages as blog posts, which get a date, a stream of posts, an RSS feed etc

###### Render highlights (^^) correctly

###### Enable folding of long pages (example [https://www.loom.com/share/246622d45cb844559ecfc2543ff1d55c](https://www.loom.com/share/246622d45cb844559ecfc2543ff1d55c) using **react-treeview**)

###### Interlinking with other people's **digital gardens**

### Embed [[Hypothes.is]] in [[digital garden]]

## Exporting and importing JSON between databases would allow for selective editing rights.
### differentiate between private, team and public database
#### It may be a better [[Roam]] workflow to write [[daily notes]] in a private database because they are mostly a tool to think
##### all thoughts that are ready for [[exchange of ideas]] would then be tagged and exported, imported to team or public database
###### however, when is a thought ready for the [[exchange of ideas]]? that is a subjective criterion. 
####### Selective visibility through [[neuronal reputation]] (with veto for privacy) would be a better solution

###### if thoughts need to be "ready" this would probably be too much of a barrier for [[exchange of ideas]]

### import of [[page]] seems to add content underneath content of already existing [[page]] with same name, which would duplicate the content at each export/import-cycle

## [About | Minerva Project](https://www.minervaproject.com/about/) [[Minerva]] [[exchange of ideas]]
### Founded in 2011 by Ben Nelson, Minerva is a pathbreaking educational innovator, preparing exceptional, lifelong learners to address the most complex challenges of our time.

### Recognized as the most selective undergraduate program in the world, the Minerva Schools is also the exemplar of the new model of learning that Minerva has pioneered.

### Building upon the best traditions of liberal arts and sciences education

### The core elements of its academic model include a Fully Active Learning pedagogy, curricula designed with Cross-Contextual Scaffolding, and a practice of Systematic Formative Feedback from peers and instructors. These are delivered via an advanced software platform, called Forum.

### Instead of focusing on content, courses emphasize crucial habits of mind and foundational concepts, which lead to the development of both adaptive skill sets and a distinct mindset.

### Eschewing lectures, Minerva classes are all discussion-driven

### The structured design of courses reinforces concepts over time

### the virtual learning environment Forum, includes multiple formats and instructor tools that enable improved evaluation of learner participation and performance—within and across courses.

### [Forum Learning Environment | Minerva Project](https://www.minervaproject.com/solutions/forum-learning-environment/)
#### content-driven educational approaches. Such practices, based on traditional classroom instruction, have been shown, time and again, to be largely ineffective

#### live, multi-stream video classes, integrated course development and management tools, and rich data collection and analysis features

#### Classes are constructed using a range of collaborative activities, including Socratic discussion, live polling, breakout groups, debate, role-playing, and simulations

#### **Features such as TalkTime, a real-time view of learner participation**

#### By incorporating deliberate, spaced practice, across multiple contexts, all Minerva curricula

#### Specific outcomes are introduced early, then reinforced throughout each course, with intentional overlap among courses. As learners progress, concepts become more complex, challenging, and interwoven. Through explicit and implicit prompts, learners are encouraged to transfer their knowledge to diverse contexts and novel situations.

#### The data can be shared across courses, instructors, and departments, leading to better integration of critique, support, and grading. Students can also follow their own performance and progress

#### **Each class session is recorded and tagged, so instructors can provide formative feedback and assessments, based on specific examples of learner performance.**

### [Modular & Custom Curricula | Minerva Project](https://www.minervaproject.com/solutions/curriculum-modules/)
#### Habits of Mind and Foundational Concepts (HCs) that underpin all Minerva courses

#### Bedrock Courses
##### **Strategic Learning & Growth**
###### This course provides tools for increasing self-awareness, and improving planning, knowledge acquisition, and decision making. Through the study of key scientific findings in learning and executive functioning, students develop practical skills for engaging in continuous cycles of reflection and learning.

##### **Expressive Clarity**
###### This course focuses on improving the clarity and style of verbal expression, across a variety of media. With an increased understanding of word choice, phrasing, sentence structure, and tone, students gain greater proficiency in written and spoken communications.

##### **Applied Algorithmic Thinking**
###### In this course, students learn to apply fundamental computer science concepts to difficult, real-world problems. From practice implementing basic algorithmic strategies in the Python programming language to the construction of functional interactive applications, students become more adept at powerful computational skills.

##### **Applied Quantitative Thinking**
###### In this course, students study topics in mathematics that are directly applicable to daily life. A key goal of the course is for students to develop intuitions about how to use mathematics to solve concrete problems, as opposed to just memorizing formulas or procedures to pass an exam. Students come away from this course with the knowledge and confidence to tackle real-world problems using mathematical tools and strategies.

## [[[[concept]] [[map]]]]

### [[A Comparison between Concept Maps, Mind Maps, Conceptual Diagrams, and Visual Metaphors as Complementary Tools for Knowledge Construction and Sharing]]

### This is related to the idea of representing links as a kind of blocks 
#### [[different kinds of links]]

#### [[Links as a necessary relation between blocks]]

#### ((0a4ea688-55cf-4669-ad58-fd3c553a7341))

#### [[translation]] creates the relation "this means approximately the same as"
##### which does not only refer to translations to other languages, but also simplified or extended reformulations of a concept to make it understandable to more people
###### such a "translation" may replace the original block (if exact match of meaning but more easily understandable expression in the same language) or add to original block (if some nuances or subtleties are lost in [[translation]], which is always the case for foreign languages)

### in the [[[[concept]] [[map]]]] [[claim]] are combinations of concepts and links. This seems to make links less useful. [[map]] of [[claim]] and [[concept]]s, structured by [[relation]]s, seem to be better.
#### maybe general distinction between [[node]]s and [[relation]]s
##### [[node]]: claims, concepts, examples, quotes, sources, comments

##### ((c6d0c938-c2e5-48d6-be3a-0b3f9067afcb))

#### maybe [[claim]] are indeed [[relation]]s between [[concept]]s
##### maybe a [[project]] has to define a vocabulary of [[concept]]s and relate them in [[claim]]

## for [[exchange of ideas]], in particular as it is related to [[project]] management, a kind of dynamic hierarchy is needed. Not a static [[Overview]] page, but a way to elevate some notes in prominence as [[priority]] or important [[claim]] – separating between drafts, input, brainstorming and [[evergreen notes]]
### any kind of dynamic ranking can only be done by [[query in [[Roam]]]] – which would need to work on [[attribute]]

## [[minimum relevant question]] is frequently binary, which could lead to a decision tree as a [[map]]
### [[relation]] "leads to" would show divergent paths to dependent [[claim]]

### then a [[question]] may always be represented by its possible answers, that is a list of [[claim]] that have the [[relation]] "contradicts"
#### which is probably a more useful way to deal with the many open [[question]]s in a [[project]]. They are then less of an impediment, reflecting more an openness to alternative paths.

## too bad that [[Roam]]'s [[Graph]] view is not useful
### it is not useful, because [[Roam]] only has one kind of [[node]] and one kind of [[relation]]
#### A better [[map]] would distinguish the more structured parts of thought ([[claim]], [[question]], [[Stories]] and their [[relation]]) and the unstructured parts: a heap of connected notes. [[Roam]] can only show the heap.

#### A better tool then [[Roam]] would combine its structure-free simplicity with a way to collaboratively structure thought
##### maybe it can be done with a common vocabulary of [[tag]] and [[attribute]], but it would still lack a useful [[map]] – unless the [[Graph]] of a single page that is a [[query]] would yield something more useful

##### this does not work:
###### a way to [[map]] different [[relation]]s in [[Roam]] would be to turn them into [[tag]] or [[page]] - NO!
####### [[claim1]] #contradicts [[claim2]]
[[claim1]] #leadsto [[claim3]]
######## the [[Graph]] would show the connection ~~via~~ the node, but all links are shown as equally prominent, therefore eclipsing more important connections
######### if the "contradicts"-[[relation]] is used frequently it would be a thicker node
########## probably not thicker on that page because there it appears only once – next to all other references to [[concept]] pages

## [[page]] for [[concept]], [[claim]], [[question]], [[Stories]]
### [[concept]] just one or two words

### [[claim]], [[question]], [[Stories]] one sentence
#### maybe avoid [[question]], start right away with competing [[claim]]s

## [[priority]] as [[Stories]] of [[shareholder]] of [[project]]

## Connection in [[exchange of ideas]] with many people needs an option to connect via prominent nodes: how to find out that you are writing thoughts about the same book, article, quote, concept as another person?
### a way would be to have an option to refer to such "connectors": an AI-based helper tool would check references to links, book metadata, quotes (like a plagiarism detector), common concepts (wiki articles?) and propose to connect to such nodes
