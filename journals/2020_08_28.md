## Ideas from notion to be discussed and transferred into stories
### Displaying Honour Bets

### Show overview of history
#### of old gift requests?

#### of how much was delivered resp. was acquired?

### Minimum Volume Support 
#### Show: "You will need to meet X people"

### How should payout of dividends work?

### Supporting hardware-wallets?

### Does it make sense to open source to project
#### more credibility?

#### bug finding?

### Knowledge-platform:
#### https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git
##### [[git]]

### General Wealth-Management
#### Alice wants to create an overview of her actual wealth and her assets without actually making offers and bids

#### New Interface: Bids and offers are created from the difference between Is / And Should in the wealth management

### Let multiple people honour-bet on a new member?

### Allow Bids without offers if a user has enough trust?

### Discriminate by Honour
#### e.g. only see certain assets or offers

### Security-enhancements:
#### Change keys more often

### Anti-Fraud:
#### Adaption of honour system, so a cheat doesn't win anything from referring himself

### Tech-improvements:
#### add pagination for bid / offer list
##### is this still necessary?

## To print a Roam page, the whole document, not just the viewport, you can use  [Print Friendly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/print-friendly-pdf/ohlencieiipommannpdfcmfdpjjmeolj?hl=en). It is an extension for Chrome, thus it works also with Brave.
