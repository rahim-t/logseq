## [[Logseq]]: the open-source project [www.logseq.com](http://www.logseq.com/). It's a Roam clone that backs up the database locally and on a personal GitHub repo. #[[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]]
### Logseq literally has all the features that Roam has, like Block Referencing, inline LaTex, and Code Block.

### Just **click the Pen icon** and you’re in drawing mode! Logseq did this by using Excalidraw

## probability of [[Links]] as relations of [[fuzzy logic]]
### [Fuzzy logic - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic)
#### Once fuzzy relations are defined, it is possible to develop fuzzy [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). The first fuzzy relational database, FRDB, appeared in [Maria Zemankova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Zemankova)'s dissertation (1983). Later, some other models arose like the Buckles-Petry model, the Prade-Testemale Model, the Umano-Fukami model or the GEFRED model by J.M. Medina, M.A. Vila et al.

#### Fuzzy querying languages have been defined, such as the [SQLf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLf) by P. Bosc et al. and the [FSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=FSQL&action=edit&redlink=1) by J. Galindo et al. These languages define some structures in order to include fuzzy aspects in the SQL statements, like fuzzy conditions, fuzzy comparators, fuzzy constants, fuzzy constraints, fuzzy thresholds, linguistic labels etc.

## Dynalist and workflowy copied from Evernote, Roam copied from Dynalist and Workflowy, Obsidian and Logseq copied from Roam and at the same time Roam copied from Obsidian and Logseq. I think the winner will be the app that has the dynamics to easily copy any feature its users ask for. #quote from Discord #[[tools for [[exchange of ideas]]]]

## [[synonym]]s in [[Roam]]: https://roamjs.com/extensions/page-synonyms/

  old.remove();

**var** s = document.createElement("script");
s.src = "https://roamjs.com/page-synonyms.js";
