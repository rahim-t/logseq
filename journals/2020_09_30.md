## [[Roam]] seems to use [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/) as Database, a mix between nosql document storage, relational database and graph database. (So basically all paradigm at once).

## [The City Gates | Forward Thinking City](https://www.forwardthinking.city/?ref=producthunt)
### We're building a virtual startup city
#### A Great Startup City Has Three Pillars

#### The Network
##### The friends you make today are tomorrow's investors, cofounders, employees, and mentors. The network of a city is its lifeblood

#### Access to Capital
##### In order to get moonshot ideas off the ground, it takes brave capital looking for brave founders. The capital flowing though a city is its potential.

#### Learning Via Osmosis
