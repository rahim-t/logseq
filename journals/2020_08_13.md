## One conceptual problem we need to solve is that with the [[problem-solving approach]] of [[exchange of talent]] problem solvers won't get any [[[[Credit]] of Trust]] any more. Right now a problem solver with high [[Honor]] can offer an amount of work hours and others can [[bid]] on those, so he gets [[Credit]].  With the new approach he can only create [[offer]] on very concrete problems.
### One answer to this could be that it's totally acceptable that problem solvers only get [[Credit]] at the moment there is a concrete problem they can solve, but that could undermine the [[usecase]] of bootstraping new projects on the basis [[work contribution]] promises as we did it with the platform itself. (One promises to bring in X hours of programming and with the [[Credit]] he gets for this [[promise]] he buys shares upfront, so a part of the development is secured from the beginning without further investment.)

### If talent areas are predefined like asset classes, a [[Skill]]-weighted promise to solve problems could allow for [[[[Credit]] of Trust]]  = [[offer]] of solving problems withing talent area
#### not offering problem-solving skill for open bids may then reduce [[Honor]], but only if [[offer]] has been made

## [[As a User of [[platform for [[exchange of assets]]]] I want to get notified when there is a first Offer to my bid so I know as fast as possible if someone can solve a problem for me]]
